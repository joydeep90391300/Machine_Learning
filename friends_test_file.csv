[Scene: Rachel‚Äôs Hospital Room, Ross is sitting next to Rachel.]
Ross: You said you‚Äôd marry Joey?
Rachel: Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have
said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) I‚Äôm not helping.
Ross: So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
Rachel: That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy
a present but I am prepared to let that go.
Ross: So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up
again, you were engaged to my best friend.
Rachel: Well‚ÄîReally? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Ross: Well, Chandler‚Äôs my oldest friend, but Joey‚Äôs my‚ÄîNo! Ah!
(points at Rachel)
Rachel: Ooooo!
Joey: (Enters) Hey you guys I‚Äôm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you
guys know, say goodbye.
Ross: Rachel said she‚Äôd marry you?!
Joey: (He looks around the room) This isn‚Äôt the right room, sorry folks.
(leaves)
Opening Credits
[Scene: Ross and Rachel‚Äôs, Monica, Phoebe, Joey and Chandler are waiting for Ross
and Rachel to come home and Monica is looking at the sign Phoebe bought that says,
""It‚Äôs a Boy!""]
Monica: Ok, I don‚Äôt wanna be negative so I‚Äôll say that most of the
signs you bought are good.
Phoebe: No they ran out of ""It‚Äôs a girl"" but I can fix this one,
(She writes ""not"" in between it‚Äôs and a) See?
Monica: (looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy.
(Waking him up.) Honey.
Chandler: Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
Monica: Honey why don‚Äôt you go lie down.
Chandler: No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the
office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?
Joey: Why‚Äôre you so tired?
Chandler: Couldn‚Äôt sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about
this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more
I couldn‚Äôt sleep.¬† Y‚Äôknow? I was like, if I fall asleep now I‚Äôll get
six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I‚Äôll get five hours sleep. Not matter what
I did I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep.
Joey: You know what you should‚Äôve done, you should have told yourself that
little story.
Rachel: (enters with Emma) Hi!
Everyone: Hi, welcome home!
Monica: Phoebe did the signs!
Rachel: Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Phoebe: Look at all the stuff people sent!
Rachel: Oh Ah! (Sees a big stuffed gorilla) Oh my gosh there‚Äôs something
every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are
people think‚Ä¶ (Reads the card) Oh you guys I love it.
Joey: Hey so where‚Äôs Ross?
Rachel: He‚Äôs downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Joey: Is he still mad at us?
Rachel: Well, you more then me, but he can‚Äôt stay to mad at me. I mean, I
just had his baby.
Joey: That‚Äôs not fair! I can‚Äôt do that.
Rachel: Yeah, I‚Äôm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
Joey: See this is what I was afraid of, I didn‚Äôt think I should be here
either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he‚Äôd be over it by now.
Chandler: Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
[Scene: A Boardroom, Chandler keeps drifting off to sleep at his meeting.]
Ms. McKenna: The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are
consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.
(Chandler drifts off and his arm slips off the table and he wakes back up.)
Ms. McKenna: Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and
on but instead of boring you I‚Äôll go straight to my forty two point plan.
(Chandler leans over to fall asleep on the man‚Äôs shoulder next to him, only the
man catches his attempt.)
Chandler: Walter (nods).
[Scene: Ross and Rachel‚Äôs, Phoebe, Monica, Ross, and Rachel are watching Emma
sleep.]
Phoebe: She‚Äôs just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a
sucking candy.
Monica: Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita
pocket.
Ross: (enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Rachel: Oh great, the pacifiers?
Ross: In the closet.
Rachel: The burping clogs?
Ross: Linen closet.
Rachel: The diapers?
Ross: In the hospital.
Phoebe: Wow you guys got a hospital?¬† Fancy!
Ross: No I left the diapers at the hospital! There‚Äôs some in the bag but
I‚Äôll run out and get some more.
Rachel: Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a
muffin?
Ross: Sure what kind?
Rachel: Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
Ross: Please take your time, it‚Äôs an important decision. Not like, say, I
know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Rachel: Blueberry.
Ross: Blueberry it is.
Rachel: Thanks.
Monica: Wow, he‚Äôs really not letting this go, is he?
Rachel: God how long do you think that‚Äôs gonna last?
Phoebe: I dunno, well he got over the ""We were on a break"" thing
really quickly.
Rachel: Y‚Äôknow I can‚Äôt even worry about that right now, cause I got
the cutie little baby, oh I can‚Äôt believe how much I love her, I can‚Äôt get
enough of her, like right now I miss her.¬† I actually miss her.
Phoebe: You know that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs her.
Rachel: Oh god look at her sleeping.¬† Oh, I love her so much!¬† Oh, I
think I‚Äôm gonna wake her up.
Phoebe: Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you‚Äôre never supposed
to wake a sleeping baby.
Rachel: Well I can do whatever I want!¬† I made her! (Waking Emma up.) Come
on little girl, hi!
(Emma starts crying)
Phoebe: I can say I told you so but she‚Äôs kinda doing that for me.
Rachel: Oh I‚Äôm sorry mummy‚Äôs so sorry go back to sleep go back to
sleep. Shh. ¬† Shhh! Go back to sleep
(Emma continues crying in the background)
Monica: Breaks your heart doesn‚Äôt it
Phoebe: It really does‚Ä¶ how long do you think we have to stay?
[Scene: A Boardroom, Chandler‚Äôs meeting continues.]
Ms. McKenna: Ok if everyone‚Äôs on board, it‚Äôs settled, Chandler,
(Walter puts his hand on Chandlers hand, Chandler sleeping puts his hand on top of his, he
then wakes up and pulls his hand away) Chandler?
Chandler: Yep.
Ms. McKenna: Are you on board?
Chandler: (not knowing what he‚Äôs saying yes to) Yes.
Ms. McKenna: Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in Tulsa.
You‚Äôre gonna love Oklahoma.
(Chandler smiles and nods then realizes what he‚Äôs agreed to.)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel‚Äôs, Emma continues crying while Rachel, Monica and Phoebe
try different methods to stop her crying.]
Phoebe: Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her,
oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Monica: Alright here‚Äôs something, it says to try holding the baby close to
your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Rachel: Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)
Monica: It worked!
Rachel: Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma starts
crying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won‚Äôt stop
crying.
Monica: Umm, she Rach, not it, she. 
Rachel: Yeah, I‚Äôm not so sure.
Monica: Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
Phoebe: Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with
Ross!
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is getting Rachel‚Äôs muffin.]
Ross: Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bag
with diapers in it on the counter.)
Gunther: Diapers huh?
Ross: Yep.
Gunther: So I guess Rachel had you baby?
Ross: Yep, can you believe it?
Gunther: Nope!¬† I still can‚Äôt believe she slept with you in the first
place.
Ross: Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a‚Ä¶ Huh?
Joey: (entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it‚Äôs Joey he
just ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know you‚Äôre pissed at me, but we
have to talk about this.
Ross: Ah actually we don‚Äôt. (Ross walks off) 
Joey:¬† Fine, fine okay.¬† But I gotta say technically, I
didn‚Äôt even do anything wrong.
Ross: (turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong?!
Joey: I said I didn‚Äôt technically.
Ross: Okay let‚Äôs put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.)
""accidentally"" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again)
""accidentally"" proposed to Rachel.
Joey: Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this
(Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don‚Äôt really know what that means. (Ross just
looks at him) You were saying?
Ross: And I can even understand that you couldn‚Äôt tell Rachel, but why
couldn‚Äôt you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn‚Äôt.
Joey: I know I should‚Äôve. (Makes quote marks again.) ""I‚Äôm
sorry."" 
Ross: Not using it right, Joe.
(He brings his hands in closer to his face then does it again.)
Ross: I‚Äôm gonna go.
Joey: No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he can‚Äôt leave) Look, Ross, we
have to get past this.
Ross: Give me the bag.
Joey: No, look, I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I said I‚Äôm sorry!
Ross: Joey!
Joey: You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
Ross: I‚Äôm not gonna hit you.
Joey: Why not?¬† You‚Äôll feel better!¬† I‚Äôll feel better, and
you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
Ross: No I don‚Äôt.
Joey: A little bit.
Ross: No.
Joey: Little bit.
Ross: No!
Joey: (excited) A little bit more.
Ross: Give me the bag.
Joey: No, hit me
Ross: Give me the bag.
Joey: Hit me.
Ross: Joey, give me the bag.
Joey: Hit me!
Ross: Joe I‚Äôm not kidding‚Ä¶
Joey: (interrupting) Hit me, hit me.
Ross: No!
Joey: (shouts) Hit me! Hit me! 
(Ross throws a punch, but Joey ducks and Ross punches the pole. Ross then screams from
the pain and turns to Gunther, and Gunther has a huge smile on his face.)
Ross: You ducked!!
Joey: I‚Äôm sorry! It was a reflex! 
Ross: Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
Joey: I couldn‚Äôt help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
(He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn‚Äôt and Joey punches Ross.
¬† Gunther is amused.)
Ross: What is the matter with you?!?
Joey: You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn‚Äôt you duck?
Ross: Why don‚Äôt we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Joey: Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we‚Äôre there, they can
check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes
quote marks.) ""Oops.""
Commercial Break
[Scene: Ross and Rachel‚Äôs, Emma is still crying.]
Monica: Try feeding her again.
Rachel: I already fed her.
Monica: I know, that‚Äôs why I said again!
Phoebe: Alright you guys, we can‚Äôt turn on each other, Okay?¬†
That‚Äôs just what she wants.
Chandler: (enters) Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Chandler: Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Rachel: Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I‚Äôm gonna go check her diaper,
Pheebs you wanna come?
Phoebe: Oh I‚Äôm kinda part of this.
Chandler: Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
Phoebe: I knew I should have married Chandler.
(Phoebe and Rachel go to the back room and Emma continues to cry in the background
while Chandler and Monica talk.)
Monica: Okay what‚Äôs up
Chandler: Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris
for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a
picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
Monica: Oh yeah (smiles).
Chandler: Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of
Oklahoma?
Monica: What? Who says that?
Chandler: People who‚Äôve never ever been to Paris.
Monica: What‚Äôs going on?
Chandler: We‚Äôre moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)
Monica: Excuse me?
Chandler: Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to
move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently,
said yes.
Monica: (stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!
Chandler: The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Monica: Chandler, I don‚Äôt even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
Chandler: Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!¬† Surrey With A
Fringe On Top.
Monica: Are you trying to tell me that we‚Äôre moving to Oklahoma, or that
you‚Äôre gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge
raise?
Chandler: No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica‚Äôs
not impressed.) I‚Äôll get out of it.
Monica: Thank you.
Chandler: (hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?
Monica: Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
[Scene: Ms. McKenna‚Äôs Office, Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Umm ma‚Äôam, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in)
I kind of have some bad news. I don‚Äôt think I can move to Tulsa.
Ms. McKenna: What?
Chandler: It‚Äôs a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in
the meeting this morning so when I said I‚Äôd move to Tulsa, I didn‚Äôt really know
what I was saying.
Ms. McKenna: You fell asleep?
Chandler: But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting,
ain‚Äôt that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here‚Äôs the
thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won‚Äôt go. See, me, I love
Tulsa!¬† Tulsa is heaven!¬† Tulsa is Italy‚ÄîPlease don‚Äôt make me go
there!
Ms. McKenna: Chandler, I‚Ä¶
Chandler: No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I
when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at
him.) That‚Äôs a picture of your daughter, isn‚Äôt it, well she‚Äôs lovely. I
like a girl with a strong jaw. I‚Äôll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)
[Scene: The Hospital, Joey is sitting in the lobby as Ross enters.]
Joey: Hey, so how is it?
Ross: I broke my thumb.
Joey: Your thumb? That‚Äôs weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure you‚Äôre
punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe
later. Ross I feel terrible.
Ross: You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to
hold the pen but can‚Äôt)
Joey: You, you want me to help you with that?
Ross: Why, does it look like I‚Äôm having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He
hands Joey the form)
Joey: Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but what‚Äôs it short for? You
know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
Ross: Just Ross!
Joey: It‚Äôs pretty, Okay date of birth?
Ross: You know my birthday.
Joey: Sure, May...tember.
Ross: October 18th.
Joey: Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Ross: Actually I‚Äôm a palian‚Ä¶ Dinosaurs is fine‚Ä¶ the drawing is
not.
Joey: Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
Ross: Ah, Rachel I guess.
Joey: Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
Ross: Just ah‚Ä¶ just put roommate.
Joey: Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you‚Äôre gonna get
together right?
Ross: I don‚Äôt think that we are.
Joey: But you two were supposed to be together.
Ross: Well, I thought so too, but then she said she‚Äôd marry you.
Joey: Come on, Ross, that didn‚Äôt mean anything! She just had the baby, she
was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
Ross: Yeah that‚Äôs what she said.
Joey: So?
Ross: So I don‚Äôt wanna be just anybody.
Joey: Wow.
Ross: You know what, it‚Äôs, it‚Äôs better this way anyway. I mean I
don‚Äôt know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It‚Äôs just
much easier if we‚Äôre just friends who have a kid.
Joey: Really?
Ross: Yeah.
Joey: And you‚Äôre Okay with that?
Ross: Yes. I mean, it‚Äôs what we always planned.¬† And if you have a
plan, you should stick to it.¬† That‚Äôs why they call them plans.¬† Hello?
(Pause) I‚Äôm fine.
Joey: Hey, for what it‚Äôs worth, with Rachel I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll
ever be just (Makes quote marks.) ""anybody.""
Ross: Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)
Joey: (makes quote marks) ""Thanks.""
(Ross looks away, not bothering)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel‚Äôs, Emma continues to cry.]
Rachel: Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
Monica: About a week and a half.
Phoebe: Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I‚Äôm
just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No!
Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)
Monica: Rach, try holding her a different way.
Rachel: You guys, I‚Äôm doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
Phoebe: Alright, I‚Äôll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
Rachel: Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)
Phoebe: Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)
Rachel: Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can‚Äôt even comfort my own
baby! I‚Äôm the worst mother ever!
Monica: You‚Äôre just new at this, it‚Äôll get better, think about your
first day at work. I mean, that couldn‚Äôt have been easy but you figured that out.
Rachel: Yeah I don‚Äôt think dressing provocatively is going to help me here!
Oh my god just please take her.
Monica: Okay I‚Äôll take her, here. (Takes Emma)
Rachel: I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)
Phoebe: I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)
Monica: (To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh
baby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)
Phoebe: (entering) Have I gone deaf?
Monica: It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
Phoebe: You must be a fireball in bed.
Monica: I can‚Äôt believe it!¬† She‚Äôs asleep!¬† I got her to go
to sleep! ¬† I have actual magical powers!
Phoebe: I can hear traffic and birds!¬† I can hear the voices in my head
again! (Monica looks at her strangely) I‚Äôm kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)
Rachel: Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
Monica: Yes I did, I‚Äôm Monica, Super Aunt
Rachel: You are the official baby crier stopper!
Monica: Yes I am!!
Rachel: You‚Äôre never leaving the apartment!
Monica: Say what?
Rachel: That‚Äôs your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you
here.
Monica: (stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!
Phoebe: Thankfully you don‚Äôt need me at all (gets up and to leave) so Okay
Super aunt see you later! Rachel let‚Äôs give it six to eight months (she leaves).
Rachel: Okay so listen I‚Äôm gonna go lay down.
Monica: What?
Rachel: You know the book says that whenever she‚Äôs sleeping I should be
sleeping so‚Ä¶ (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)
Chandler: (entering, loudly) Hey!
Monica: Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
Chandler: Oh so there can‚Äôt be any yelling.
Monica: No.
Chandler: We‚Äôre moving to Tulsa
Monica: (loudly) What!?
Chandler: Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I
can‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt hear you. (He runs out)

Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Heeeeey, where have you been? (He shows her his thumb) What happened to
you?
Ross: Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see
him.
Rachel: Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really
wanted to marry Joey, okay?
Ross: Okay.
Rachel: You know what I really really want?
Ross: What, Rach?
Rachel: I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she
wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
Ross: (smiles) Right.
Rachel: I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?¬† Not easy.
Ross: Well, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want
me to get that?
Rachel: No its really okay‚Ä¶ Monica!
Monica: (comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it!
Got it! Got it! Got it!
Closing Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are sitting at one of the high tables.]
Joey: You know, ah, I‚Äôve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya,
it‚Äôs not my fault. It‚Äôs a natural instinct.
Chandler: (enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?
Joey: Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler,
he moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up and
just stares at Joey.)

Joey: A year?!
Rachel: (To Monica) Do you have to go?
Monica: I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid
  thing (Points to her wedding ring.)
Chandler: There is nothing like the support of your loving
  wife, huh?
Joey: Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot,
  but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
Chandler: I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be
  able to make it.
Joey: We were gonna go see the Jets!
Ross: You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this
  group together!
Chandler: Really?
Ross: Not you.
Joey: I can't believe you guys are moving.
Phoebe: I call their apartment!!!
Everyone: No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!! 
 [INTRO]
[Scene: Central Perk]
Joey: Here you are (Hands Rachel a cup of coffee)
Rachel: Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure
  I can have caffeine.
Ross: I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee
  won't affect your milk.
Rachel: Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener. 
Joey: (Laughs)
Rachel: Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts
  dialing.)
Joey: Uhuh.
Ross: Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little
  question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
Rachel: All right, I trust you. (Continues to dial)
Ross: Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Rachel: I'm on the phone! (On the phone) Dr. Wiener? (Ross
  and Rachel walk away)
Joey: (Laughs)
Phoebe: It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.
  It's just so grown up.
Joey: I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person
  named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)
Phoebe: Look at you all grown up.
Joey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with
  Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.
  You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks
  aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
Phoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you
  set me up with someone, and we double date!
Joey: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
Phoebe: Done. Oh good, really?
Joey: Yeah! 
Phoebe: Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know
  who's great? Sandy Poophack. 
Joey: (Laughs) Poophack... (Laughs)
Phoebe: Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller
Joey: (Laughs)
[SCENE: Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Chandler: (Enters) Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: I've got good news!
Monica: You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Chandler: Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa.
  You can stay here and keep your job. 
Monica: It's great! How?
Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only
  have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with
  you.
Monica: So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks
  about it.) No.
Chandler: I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
Monica: No. I can't be away from you for that long.
Chandler: Really?
Monica: Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a
  different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Chandler: That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa. 
Monica: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but
  if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
Chandler: Hey, you said that without gagging!
Monica: I know! (They high-five.) 
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment]
Rachel: (On the phone) Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours
too! (Hangs up)
Ross: (Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!
Rachel: Dr. Wiener. 
Ross: Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning. 
Rachel: Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Ross: Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Rachel: Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Ross: Well, what was it?
Rachel: Hiccups.
Ross: Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any
  little thing comes up. 
Rachel: Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What
  are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that
  when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
Ross: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a
  good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
Rachel: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
Ross: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another
  doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Rachel: What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well?
  What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had
  that shot.
Ross: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
  (Walks back into his room.)
Rachel: (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In
  a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!
Ross: (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!
Rachel: Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
[Scene: Joey's apartment]
Phoebe: (Enters) Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: So how is this for our big double date tonight? (She
  is all dressed up)
Joey: (Realizes that he has forgotten all about the double
  date) Oh my God!
Phoebe: Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for. 
Joey: Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget? 
Phoebe: Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen.
  She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this,
  but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy. 
Joey: No.
Phoebe: Come on, give me something. What's his name?
Joey: Mike.
Phoebe: Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
Joey: Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
Phoebe: All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant
  in a couple hours.
Joey and Phoebe: (Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves)
Joey: Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why
  couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in
  there! 
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Rachel: It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how
  do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against
  your knee?
Monica: Excuse me?
Chandler: I know what she's talking about.
Rachel: We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting
  sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.
Monica: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman? 
Rachel: Ross said he died. 
Monica: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said
  he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
Rachel: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see
  him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
Monica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood
  therapist.
Chandler: He saw a therapist?
Monica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just
  really freaked him out.
Rachel: Why? What was it?
Monica: That I was going to eat him.
[Scene: Central Perk]
 (Joey walks in and looks around. He's trying to find a Mike for Phoebe)
Joey: MIKE!!!
Mike: Yeah? 
Joey: (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and
  sits down with him)
[Scene: Restaurant]
Mike: I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with
  you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I
  should be open and taking some risks.
Joey: Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay?
  All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
Mike: I am Mike.
Joey: Atta boy!
 (Phoebe and Mary Ellen enter.)
Joey: Okay, look...
Everyone: (Ad-lib hellos)
Phoebe: Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do
  you and Joey know each other anyway?
Mike: How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a
  nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.
Joey: (Laughs) From school.
Mike: Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean,
  high school.
Phoebe: Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up
  to these days?
Mike: Well, I'm a lawyer.
Joey: Mike, 'attorney at law'!
Mike: Actually, I just gave up my practice.
Joey: What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Mike: I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I
  figured if I don't do this now, I never will.
Phoebe: Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law
  thing, so...
Joey: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to
  Mike.
Mary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
Joey: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]
 (Monica Enters. Chandler is in the kitchen with his laptop)
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Monica: What are you doing?
Chandler: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Monica: That's so sweet. Find anything?
Chandler: Slim Pickings.
Monica: Nothing, huh?
Chandler: No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.
  They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're
  looking for someone to shovel mesquite. 
Monica: 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
Chandler: 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Monica: Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,
  who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
Chandler: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming
  with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.
  'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Monica: (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm
  good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been
  relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?)
  is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this
  is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo
  (sp?) 'I'll take it!'
[Scene: Pediatrician's office]
Rachel: Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment
  for Emma.
Receptionist: Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient,
  he should be out shortly.
Dr. Gettleman: (To a patient) I think you just have a cold,
  it's definitely not Strep.
Ross: Thanks doctor.
Dr. Gettleman: Would you like a lollypop?
Ross: You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of
  a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!
[Scene: Restaurant]
Phoebe: You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have
  known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
Joey: Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.
  Mike hit my mom with a car.
Mike: No, I didn't.
Joey: That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're
  friends again everything's great!
Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?
Joey: Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes
  the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)
Mary Ellen: Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.
Mike: 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!
Phoebe: What?!
Mike: What?!
Joey: What?!
Phoebe: Do you not know each other?
Joey: (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that
  we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other.
  We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch
  you in the face for not being cool?!
Phoebe: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters
  does Joey have?
Mike: (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!
Joey: What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.)
  (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!
Phoebe: Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
Joey: Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
Mike: I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his
  mother with a car.
Phoebe: (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time
  finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and
  cute and loose.
Mary Ellen: Hey!
Phoebe: Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some
  guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Joey: Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like
  this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!
Phoebe: I'm out of here (She leaves)
Mike: It was nice meeting you!
Joey: (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?
Mary Ellen: I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
Joey: Good night! 
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Chandler: Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got
  a lot of packing to do.
Monica: You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.
Chandler: What?
Monica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,
  Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Chandler: How far outside?
Monica: Manhattan.
Chandler: And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before
  you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now
  it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job. 
Monica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot
  to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Chandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four
  days a week'?
Monica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days
  is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see
  you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really
  if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make
  it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
Chandler: I think you should take the job.
Monica: Really?
Chandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you
  start chattering like a monkey.
Monica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
 (Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)
Ross: Hey!
Monica: How was the pediatrician?
Rachel: Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it
  was really, really, really good.
Ross: You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Rachel: I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!
  (To Ross) I don't care!
Monica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Ross: He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Chandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Rachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate
  doctor.
Ross: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's
  a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,
  he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Chandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer
  in your touchy?
Ross: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security
  blanket to college!
Chandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Ross: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
[Scene: Central Perk]
Mike: Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can
  we talk?
Phoebe: Sure.
Mike: I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm
  a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny
  guy.
Phoebe: Why did you go along with that?
Mike: Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't.
  And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.
Phoebe: That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me
  about yourself true?
Mike: My name in Mike, and I do play piano.
Phoebe: Prove it.
Mike: There isn't a piano here.
Phoebe: That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
Mike: (Plays 'air piano')
Phoebe: You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
Mike: Really?
Phoebe: Uhuh.
Mike: That's great. What kind of music do you play?
Phoebe: Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right
  now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers. 
Mike: Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...
Phoebe: It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
Mike: Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you
  out?
Joey: (Walks In)
Phoebe: (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah,
  that would be nice.
Joey: Look at this. My two best friends!
 (Phoebe and Mike look at him, and he goes over to the counter.)
[Scene: Pediatrician's office]
Ross: Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby
  with the rash came in after me.
Receptionist: The doctor will be right with you sir.
Girl: (Reading a book) Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
Ross: With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
Woman: Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books
  too?
Ross: Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Sally: Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also
  a single parent?
Ross: I am a single parent.
Sally: It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social
  life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?
Ross: Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the
  pediatrician's office.
Nurse: (To Ross) Rossy, we're ready for you.
Ross: Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come
  on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
Boy: Mommy (He walks over to Sally.)
Girl: Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
Ross: Hey, I helped you find Waldo! 
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]
Ross: (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.
Monica: Where have you been?
Ross: I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was
  some guy that freaked everybody out.
Chandler: Well, you got here just in time. I really have
  to go buddy. (They hug)
Ross: Oh man.
Monica: Promise to call me when you land.
Chandler: Of course I will call you. I love you.
Monica: I love you too. (They kiss)
Rachel: Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've
  got a baby over here.
Phoebe: Bye Chandler.
Chandler: Awww. (They hug) Bye!
Rachel: Bye honey. (They hug)
Chandler: (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the
  matter Joe?
Joey: I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big
  leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Chandler: Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make
  all this easier?
Joey: Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads
  for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)
Chandler: Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
Phoebe: Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good
  trip! (Slams the door)
Monica: (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes:
  Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you. This
  is just something I have to do.
Chandler: I know.
Monica: I love you so much.
Chandler: I know that too. (They kiss)
 (Joey opens the door and takes Chandler's suitcase into his own apartment.)
[Scene: Airport]
Chandler: (On cell phone) Don't worry, I'll be back before
  you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
CUT TO: Monica and Chandler's apartment.
Joey: (On the phone with Chandler) Double promise? Call me
  when you land.
Monica: Can I talk now?
Joey: Okay, bye. (He hangs up the phone.)
Monica: Joey?
Joey: He had to board.

[Scene: Chandler's hotel room in Tulsa. He's fast asleep when the telephone 
  rings.]
Chandler: (picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog 
  in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog 
  in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?
Monica: (in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Chandler: Honey, you're screaming.
Monica: YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day 
  ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Chandler: (yawning) Oh, that's great.
Monica: Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... 
  Monica clean.
Chandler: (clearly not so interested) Awesome.
Monica: Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, 
  Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, 
  the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits 
  up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)
OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are on the couch, holding hands, while 
  Phoebe puts milk in her coffee.]
Mike: This is nice.
Phoebe: I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, 
  shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want 
  to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)
Mike: You need both hands for that?
Phoebe: Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, 
  how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open 
  the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. 
  After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting 
  on the couch, holding hands.)
Joey: (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look 
  at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, 
  embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? 
  (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are 
  becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, 
  huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)
Phoebe: I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early 
  for us to be... having that conversation.
Mike: Is it?
Phoebe: (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?
Mike: Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this 
  way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet 
  someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have 
  this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... 
  Phoebe looks in a ""what's happening"" face to him. He finally has found 
  something) No, not... that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... 
  I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...
Phoebe: (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
Mike: Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what 
  he's been looking for. A key.)
Phoebe: Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the 
  five dollars.
Mike: It's to my apartment.
Phoebe: (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for 
  Phoebe and Mike.
Mike: Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have 
  to give me your key just because...
Phoebe: Oh no, I want to.
Mike: Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets 
  her keychain from her bag.)
Phoebe: Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never 
  meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both 
  Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)
Mike: Is this cool, huh?
Phoebe: It really is.
Joey: (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It 
  is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with 
  his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a ""yeah, yeah, yeah"" way.)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Both of them sitting on the couch, interviewing 
  a nanny candidate.]
Rachel: So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, 
  but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance 
  to know her.
Prospective nanny: (in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's 
  really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross 
  and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)
Rachel: That's great, great. So do you have any questions 
  for us?
Prospective nanny: Not really.
Rachel: Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're 
  standing up and make their way to the door)
Ross: Thank you.
Rachel: Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Prospective nanny: Oh, you know, wait. I do have 
  one question. (she starts playing with her hair) Do you guys do random drug 
  testing?
Ross: Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Prospective nanny: That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm 
  gonna need three days notice.
Rachel: Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face 
  while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Ross: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews 
  (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider 
  the uhm... the first one we met with.
Rachel: (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?
Ross: She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but 
  then gets a ""gotcha"" expression on his face... There's knocking at 
  the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree 
  in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three 
  years.
Rachel: Okay... (Ross opens the door.)
Sandy: (a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy.
Ross: And she's a little mannish...
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. There's a knock on the door, and Phoebe opens it.]
Phoebe: (gasps) Oh my God! David!
David: Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
Phoebe: (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, 
  hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
David: Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to 
  explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that 
  we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
Phoebe: Who cares, it got you here.
David: Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got 
  on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your 
  address I... I... I didn't even think about it.
Phoebe: Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)
David: Damn it!
Phoebe: A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
David: Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you 
  just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, 
  uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that 
  means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!
Phoebe: Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, 
  no, I look pretty good.
David: Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see 
  someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and 
  you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, 
  but... well, you are. (Phoebe seems very charmed) Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... 
  anyone? (Phoebe is still up on a cloud from what David just said)
Phoebe: No...
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica sits on the couch and Phoebe 
  is pacing up and down the room.]
Phoebe: I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How 
  can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Monica: Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Phoebe: He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
Monica: Oh, well... That had been your window.
Phoebe: Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, 
  I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's 
  here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
Monica: Really? The scientist guy?
Phoebe: Really? Chandler?
Monica: Continue...
Phoebe: Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him 
  that I would see him tomorrow night.
Monica: Phoebe!
Phoebe: I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... 
  I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
Monica: Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the 
  same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Phoebe: (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given 
  my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
Monica: What are you gonna do?
Phoebe: I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that 
  nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated 
  moral situation, no right, no wrong...
Monica: You have to tell David!
Phoebe: Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation 
  with Joey.
[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler comes home.]
Chandler: (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) 
  I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock 
  jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for 
  inside! (he enters)
Monica: Heeeeeey! 
Chandler: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Chandler: So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they 
  call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica 
  looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma 
  having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from 
  the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Monica: (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin 
  pressurised?
Chandler: (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get 
  me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Phoebe: Okay. (and she walks away)
Chandler: What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two 
  words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, 
  I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried 
  chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica 
  laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Monica: No, it just remind me of something this guy did today 
  at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Chandler: Yeah, he came up...
Monica: Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, 
  but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe 
  bursts out in a laugh)
Chandler: (to Phoebe) Were you there?
Phoebe: No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. They're interviewing Sandy.]
Sandy: I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave 
  your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your 
  heart... (Ross has got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)
Rachel: Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
Ross: Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed 
  way)
Rachel: Ross!
Sandy: It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I 
  am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.
Rachel: Oh!
Sandy: Her name is Deliah.
Rachel: Oh, that's pretty.
Ross: (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Sandy: I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, 
  but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is 
  take care of a child.
Ross: (on a yeah, right tone) Okay.
Sandy: Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three 
  weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... 
  When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... (Ross 
  and Rachel look puzzled) That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... 
  right in... (points at his heart, but starts to cry before he can finish his 
  sentence. Rachel tries to comfort him, but Ross has this ""you've got to 
  be kidding me"" look all over him)
Ross: Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room 
  Emma starts to cry.)
Rachel: Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Sandy: Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
Rachel: Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's 
  room) I love him, I love him, I love him...
Ross: Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
Rachel: So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good 
  reason we shouldn't try him out.
Ross: Because, it's weird!
Rachel: Why?
Ross: What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's 
  like if a woman wanted to be...
Rachel: (she's got that ""yeah, try to say it"" look 
  on her face) Yes?
Ross: King?
Sandy: I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made 
  lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that 
  rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... (it makes Rachel smile)
Rachel: (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a ""whatever"" 
  gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired.
Sandy: That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his 
  hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm 
  sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new 
  family...
Rachel: Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
Ross: You gotta be at least bi...
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey is reading a 'Busty Ladies' magazine when Chandler 
  enters.]
Chandler: Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a 
  minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits 
  for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica 
  is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
Joey: Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering 
  lines.
Chandler: (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your 
  livelihood doesn't depend on it.
Joey: I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) 
  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Chandler: Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy 
  she's ever met.
Joey: Seriously? She actually said that?
Chandler: Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
Joey: Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Chandler: Yeah!
Joey: Without that, you just got ""lame with women"".
Chandler: Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just 
  said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)
Monica: Hi! There you are.
Joey: (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in 
  size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he 
  turns back to Joey, who says ""you're welcome"" without a sound)
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe just let David in who brought a bottle of 
  wine.]
David: Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
Phoebe: Oof...
David: In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. (David holds 
  Phoebe and wants to kiss her.)
Phoebe: Oh, wait, wait!
David: Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. 
  I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...
Phoebe: No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) 
  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, 
  uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
David: Oh... oh...
Phoebe: Yeah, I should have told you.
David: No... well, yeah.
Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
David: Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, 
  are you happy with this guy?
Phoebe: I am happy.
David: Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want 
  you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, 
  leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I 
  should probably uhm... go...
Phoebe: Well... but David, just... I just want you to know 
  that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things 
  I've ever had to do.
David: Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly 
  a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?
Phoebe: Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little 
  after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss 
  on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
David: No... no...
Phoebe: I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes 
  his way to the door and turns around again)
David: In Minsk...
Phoebe: Yeah?
David: ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... 
  and one on the lips.
Phoebe: Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 
  2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... 
  it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... 
  They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Sandy sit on the couch. Sandy 
  holds Emma. Ross enters the apartment. Sandy and Rachel wipe their tears away 
  with handkerchiefs]
Rachel: (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around 
  and sees Ross) Hi...
Ross: (very worried) Is everything allright?
Rachel: Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was 
  just telling me about how he proposed to his fianc√©e and it was just 
  sooo beautiful.
Sandy: Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the 
  poem...
Rachel: I can't... I can't hear it again.
Sandy: You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears 
  again)
Ross: And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks 
  at Ross in a ""why do you say that"" manner) Rach, can I... can I see 
  you for a sec?
Rachel: Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen 
  with Ross and sighs)
Ross: Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three 
  times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Rachel: Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, 
  that's all.
Ross: (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that 
  is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)
Rachel: What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Ross: (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things 
  that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!
Rachel: Sandy made Madeleines.
Ross: This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What 
  kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... 
  butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a 
  careful bite from the cookie)
Rachel: Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... 
  I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. 
  You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in 
  from branding cattle.
Ross: Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Rachel: Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's 
  music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and 
  he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved 
  by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the 
  kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She and David are still kissing each other in the 
  living room.]
Phoebe: Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
David: But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and 
  good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
Phoebe: No, no. No.
David: But... ergo...
Phoebe: Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, 
  we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with 
  Mike and I really care about him...
David: Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... 
  ui... (David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's 
  a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)
Mike: Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't 
  want to believe what's happening)
Phoebe: (points to David) And you thanks for the 
  face massage. Thank you.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen and Ross 
  enters.]
Ross: Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
Monica: Yeah! I think that's great!
Ross: Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites 
  poetry and bakes Madeleines?
Monica: Oh... How are they?
Ross: (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes 
  back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Joey: (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... 
  weird...
Ross: Thank you!
Joey: That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Ross: ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Monica: Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Joey: Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's 
  hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler 
  that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Monica: Yeah, so?
Ross: Wow!
Joey: Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Monica: Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? 
  Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Joey: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... 
  You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)
Ross: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
Joey: ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)
Monica: I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Joey: Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 
  'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Heeeyy! Hey!
Chandler: What are you guys talking about?
Ross: Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes 
  a gesture and sound like ""Can you believe that?"")
Chandler: You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? 
  (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should 
  laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler 
  seems happy again.)
Chandler: You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do 
  draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)
Monica: Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
Chandler: If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would 
  have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)
Monica: Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica 
  wipes away tears)
Chandler: What is so funny about that? (they realise 
  it wasn't a joke)
Monica: Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say 
  it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! 
  (Chandler turns to Joey)
Chandler: Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts 
  laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)
Joey: Yeah....
Chandler: So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and 
  Ross walk away from the kitchen)
Monica: Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with 
  Geoffrey.
Chandler: Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Monica: Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, 
  you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... 
  and... and limericks...
Chandler: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named 
  Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
Monica: Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, 
  you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the 
  girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.
Ross: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points 
  at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross ""What are you doing?)
Joey: Not knowing when to shut up...
Ross: Yep! That's my thing...
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. David is still there. Mike closes the door.]
Mike: So... how many guys have your key?
Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts 
  not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
Mike: Your lipstick's on his mouth.
David: Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
Phoebe: No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years 
  ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
Mike: Did you uhm...
Phoebe: No, no... 
Mike: ...kiss him?
Phoebe: Oh, well, yeah...
David: Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes 
  you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella. 
  (he points at Mike)
Mike: Don't point your finger at me.
David: Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
Mike: Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about 
  it... (he hits David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight 
  using their fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)
Phoebe: Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! 
  (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you 
  should just go.
David: Allright... But... if I ever do come back 
  from Minsk... (points at Mike) well, you just better watch out.
Mike: Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd 
  better watch out.
David: Oh, you're going to Minsk?
Mike: Well, I might.
David: Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just 
  lovely there.
Phoebe: Okay, well... guys?
David: Right... Goodbye Phoebe. (Makes a move to kiss her.)
Mike: Hey, what are you kidding me?
David: Right-o, right-o... (to Mike) Take good care of her. 
  (and he leaves)
Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your 
  key back, I totally understand.
Mike: It's never gonna happen again right?
Phoebe: Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door 
  opens and David comes in again.)
David: I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever 
  come to Minsk, that's my number (gives Mike a business card) We'll uhm... we'll 
  party up Vladnik style. (He leaves again)
[Scene: Ross walks in the hallway to his apartment and stops in front of his 
  own door. Now he hears two recorders playing a song. When he enters, Sandy and 
  Joey are playing the recorder and Rachel listens.]
Joey: Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught 
  me Hot-cross Buns.
Ross: Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Joey: Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts 
  his fingers in position on the recorder)
Ross: (looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to 
  God...! (Joey is in shock)
Sandy: Who's up for puppets?
Joey: Me! I'm up for puppets!
Sandy: Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants 
  to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
Ross: Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed 
  to appreciate puppets?
Sandy: Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours 
  help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. 
  (He winks to Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that 
  and kind of angrily says...)
Joey: I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a ""there"" 
  nod to Ross)
Ross: (shakes his head) Oh my God!
Sandy: Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus... 
  (Ross goes to the kitchen)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's kitchen. Ross got a beer from the refrigerator and 
  opens the bottle. Rachel now also enters the kitchen.]
Rachel: That was kind of rude!
Ross: Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps 
  for me.
Rachel: You know, he was just doing his job...
Ross: Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one 
  who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I 
  can't go through with this.
Rachel: Oh, come on Ross...
Ross: No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force 
  you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Rachel: (sighs) Oh... That's true.
Ross: Thank you!
Rachel: Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're 
  gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)
[Scene: Living room. Joey and Sandy are talking with the Snufflebumps.]
Sandy: (In a puppet voice) So you see Wigglemunch, that's 
  why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
Joey: (kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica and Joey are sitting at the 
  dinner table. Chandler comes from the bedroom with his suitcase.]
Chandler: Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend 
  has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
Monica: Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey 
  told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
Chandler: Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep 
  it smart, people!
Monica: Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
Chandler: I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns 
  to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the 
  back.) 
Joey: Allright. See you later!
Chandler: See ya! (he leaves the apartment)
Joey: (to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?
Monica: Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing 
  so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Sandy is knitting baby clothes. Ross and 
  Rachel walk into the living room.]
Ross: Here goes...
Rachel: I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks 
  to the couch where Sandy sits)
Ross: Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid 
  it's not working out.
Sandy: (surprised) Oh...
Ross: Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... 
  with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
Rachel: (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!
Ross: I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. 
  I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Sandy: Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers 
  from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
Rachel: (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!
Ross: Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
Sandy: No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever 
  is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? 
  Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
Ross: No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's 
  uhm... my issue.
Sandy: What is it...? (Ross hesitates) Please...? (he tilts 
  his head)
Ross: You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with 
  a guy who's as sensitive as you.
Sandy: That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think 
  that is?
Ross: Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) 
  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
Sandy: hmmm... (and shakes his head)
Ross: I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was 
  kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
Rachel: (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!
Ross: I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get 
  the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Sandy: That must have been hard.
Ross: It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... 
  playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father 
  walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things? 
  What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like 
  a... like a real boy?
Sandy: But you are a real boy!
Ross: I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's 
  summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
Sandy: It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos 
  out. 
Ross: Here come some more...
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey and Sandy are sitting at the kitchen counter. 
  Joey is holding mr. Wigglemunch, and Sandy holds the Grumpus.]
Sandy/Grumpus: And what's the one kind of boat that can never, 
  ever sink?
Joey/Wigglemunch: What kind?
Sandy/Grumpus: A friend-ship...
Joey: Wow! You blow my mind...
Sandy: Oh, I gotta go.
Joey: Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Sandy: Twenty bucks.
Joey: It's like the cheapest college ever.

The One With Ross's Inappropriate Song



907 - The One With Ross's Inappropriate Song

Written by: Robert Carlock
  Transcribed by: Coffee Mug
Dedicated to the great work of Eric Aasen, Guineapig and many, many more.

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Ross is playing with Emma on the couch 
  after just changing her diaper.]
Ross: And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really 
  were on a break. (baby talk) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up) Come 
  here gorgeous. (puts her on his knees and talks to her) Oh! Look at you! You 
  are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know 
  that? But you've got... (in a softer voice) You've got big beautiful eyes... 
  Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the B's) Big baby 
  butt! I like big butts. (raps) I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other 
  brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and 
  a round thing in your face you get...(Emma laughs) Oh my God, Emma... you're 
  laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done 
  that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? 
  What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...(raps) My anaconda don't want 
  none / unless you got buns hon... (Emma laughs again and Ross looks worried) 
  I'm a terrible father!
OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Central Perk. Joey sits at a table and Chandler and Monica enter.]
Chandler: Hi!
Joey: Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
Chandler: How come?
Joey: Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and 
  I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
Monica: What do you do with your money now?
Joey: Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. 
  (realises that anyone could have overheard that) I didn't say that! It's in 
  a bank guarded by robots!
Chandler: Do you have any ideas?
Joey: Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going 
  in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping 
  to plant the emus...
Monica: Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Joey: (laughs) Yeah! Right! (points at Monica) People eat 
  birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you 
  go to a restaurant and you say: ""Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried 
  bird."" (laughs again) Or... or maybe just a wing or... (realises...)
Monica: Joey, I think you should consider something a little 
  less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The 
  Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. 
  (looks at Chandler) That's right, I know some stuff!
Joey: Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
Monica: (very excited) Oh, and you know who's selling a great 
  apartment? Richard!
Chandler: (imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge 
  of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
Monica: My dad told me. They play golf together.
Chandler: Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just 
  hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Rachel and Monica are sitting at the 
  dinner table and Phoebe enters, knocking on the door.]
Phoebe: Hi!
Rachel and Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm 
  meeting Mike's parents tonight! (Rachel gasps)
Monica: Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
Phoebe: (sarcastically) Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
Monica: They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
Phoebe: They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
Rachel: Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
Phoebe: Okay, so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up 
  two 'Phoebe' dresses, Rachel and Monica look at them... taking their time, don't 
  wanting to hurt Phoebe) You can say ""neither"".
Rachel and Monica: Oh God, neither!
Monica: I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. 
  It's gonna be fine.
Rachel: Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm 
  so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a 
  little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: ""Oh mr. Pincer, 
  I can see where Wallis gets his good looks...""
Monica: You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Rachel: Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
Monica: I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Rachel: Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
Phoebe: So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
Rachel: Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell 
  her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time 
  actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
Monica:  (Monica looks at Rachel in disbelief) She said WHAT?
Phoebe: (speaking louder and articulating) That's she's like 
  the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears) Listen! (Monica looks 
  at Phoebe in a duh! way)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel enters the apartment.]
Rachel: Hi.
Ross: Hi.
Rachel: I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet 
  Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!
Ross: Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
Rachel: (in disbelief) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because 
  I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
Ross: Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person 
  laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... (Ross tries to impersonate Emma's laugh, 
  but it comes out very squeaky, very high pitched. He laughs about himself but 
  then looks at Rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.) 
  Only... only not creepy.
Rachel: Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)
Ross: I uhm... Well, I sang... (Rachel gasps) well actually 
  I rapped... Baby Got Back... (Rachel's face changes from excited to angry)
Rachel: You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song 
  about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
Ross: But you know what, if you think about it, it actually 
  promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... 
  juicy doubles.
Rachel: (disgusted) owwwww...
Ross: Please don't take her away from me!
[Scene: Richard's apartment. There's a knock on the door.The listing agent 
  opens the door for Chandler and Joey.]
Catherine: Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.
Joey: Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Chandler: So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? 
  Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
Catherine: Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's 
  got a great view of Central Pa.....
Chandler: mmm That's enough about you!
Joey: Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
Catherine: All the appliances are included. There is a lot 
  of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here... (Joey 
  and Chandler both realise what she's assuming and start laughing.)
Chandler: No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. 
  We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
Catherine: Oh... Okay, sorry!
Joey: Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not 
  good enough for you? 
Chandler: We're not gonna have this conversation again... 
  Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this 
  huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about 
  losing Monica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey 
  looks around)
Joey: You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see 
  I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... (Joey sits 
  down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants) Yeah, 
  I could see it.
Chandler: (Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets 
  caught by Richard's video collection) Look at these videos. You know, I mean, 
  who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my 
  God!
Joey: What?
Chandler: There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Joey: Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a 
  sex tape... (realises) Wait a minute... This says Monica... (looks around) And 
  this is Richard's apartment... (realises some more)
Chandler: Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...)
[Scene: Mike's parents building. Phoebe gets out of the classy elevator, looking 
  all dressed up like an older woman, and very un-Phoebe. She walks to the door 
  and rings the doorbell.]
Mike: Wow! You look like... like my mom.
Phoebe: I'm wearing pantyhose!
Mike: Great! Come on in! (Mike kisses her on the cheek. A 
  butler walks in and takes Phoebe's coat.)
Phoebe: Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
Mike: No, my parents are rich.
Phoebe: Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. (Mike's parents 
  walk in) HELLO!
Mike: Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: 
  Theodore and Bitsy.
Phoebe: (in a very posh accent) Theodore... Bitsy... What 
  a delight!
Bitsy: It's so nice to finally meet you!
Phoebe: And you... Your home is lovely.
Bitsy: Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually 
  three floors.
Phoebe: Holy crap!
Bitsy: Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet 
  our friends?
Phoebe: Oh, try and stop me!
Mike: Hey... Wh... What are you doing?
Phoebe: (no accent) I'm trying to get your parents to like 
  me.
Mike: Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... 
  I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not (accent) Phoebe...
Phoebe: (accent) Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
Mike: Well, come on...
Theodore: Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
Bitsy: Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... 
  So where are you from?
Phoebe: (no accent) Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally 
  I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went 
  to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a 
  burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay, 
  that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit 
  in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... 
  a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money 
  but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit 
  surreal, which Phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again) So... 
  where does everyone summer?
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Mike's parents house again.]
Phoebe: God! God! This is not going well.
Mike: No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you 
  go talk to my dad?
Phoebe: Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being 
  myself?
Mike: Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
Phoebe: So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets 
  his good looks from...
Theodore: Oh... Well...
Phoebe: Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the 
  time...
Theodore: Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...
Phoebe: Yeah I bet! Look out! (Phoebe punches Theodore right 
  in the stomach)
Theodore: OH! OWWWWW! (Theodore grabs his stomach in agony)
Phoebe: Oh my God, are you okay?
Theodore: I recently had surgery.
Phoebe: I'm so sorry!
Theodore: No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...
Phoebe: I really, really am sorry.
Theodore: How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in 
  the stomach? (Theodore walks out... Mike walks towards Phoebe)
Mike: Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?
Phoebe: Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents 
  before...
Mike: But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, 
  why don't you go talk to my mom?
Phoebe: Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, 
  I can talk to her.
Mike: Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of 
  internal bleeding. (Mike walks away and Bitsy walks in the same direction.)
Phoebe: Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted 
  to thank you again for having me here tonight.
Bitsy: Well, not at all...
Phoebe: Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful 
  man your son is.
Bitsy: Thank you, I think so too.
Phoebe: Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how 
  he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.
Bitsy: Is he really?
Phoebe: Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings 
  and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle 
  lover.
Bitsy: E-e-excuse me?
Phoebe: (Mike now enters and stands behind Phoebe) Oh no, 
  no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, 
  no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
Bitsy: That's... my boy. (Bitsy walks away)
Mike: Awesome!
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Only Chandler is there with the videotape 
  in his hands, standing in front of the TV set.]
Chandler: I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch 
  it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) Well, we 
  know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey 
  enters the apartment)
Joey: Hey dude, what's up?
Chandler: Don't judge me, I'm only human!
Joey: Did you take that tape?
Chandler: I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and 
  you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need 
  to know what was on it?
Joey: I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
Chandler: Some girl...!?
Joey: She hot?
Chandler: Yeah...!?
Joey: How did she get me to settle down?
Chandler: Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's 
  probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly 
  be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) Can it?
Joey: Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes 
  to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...
Chandler: Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Joey: (backs off) What? Whoo... What?
Chandler: Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... 
  Please?
Joey: All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only 
  yourself to blame... (Chandler turns his back to the TV. Joey puts the tape 
  in the VCR, switches it on and watches what's on the tape... It's clearly a 
  american football match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...)
Chandler: Why am I hearing cheering?
Joey: Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
Chandler: Football? Just football?
Joey: Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
Chandler: It's football... It's just football... This is great! 
  This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to 
  get a beer... (Chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the TV and a 
  moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in size...) 
  What the... (Chandler turns around, but Joey already took a sprint for Chandler, 
  jumps, and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) 
  What are you doing?
Joey: You don't wanna see what I just saw! (at this moment 
  Monica comes home, and sees Chandler flat on his back on the floor and Joey 
  pinning him down)
Monica: What are you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning 
  coming from the TV and looks at it) Oh my God, is that Richard? (It only takes 
  a split second for Joey to realise, he pulls Monica down by her jacket, and 
  she falls, face down next to Chandler. Chandler gets up a bit, and Joey quickly 
  covers Chandler's eyes with his hand.)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Emma is sitting in her chair on the apothecary 
  table and Rachel is trying to make her laugh.]
Rachel: Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? 
  Please laugh for mommy... (Rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, 
  making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... 
  No response from Emma...) Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty 
  rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... (Rachel 
  tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) My 
  name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't 
  rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I 
  know that you're not gonna tell anybody... (Rachel's face is telling ""Oh 
  what am I doing? The things I have to go through... and she starts to rap) I 
  like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when 
  a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (Emma 
  starts to laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! (Rachel now really gets into 
  it, and her insecure movements start getting better) I like big butts and 
  I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! 
  Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little 
  weirdo... (Rachel picks up Emma and Ross now enters)
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. 
  It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
Ross: Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her 
  to laugh?
Rachel: Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... 
  I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
Ross: You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
Rachel: Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
[Scene: Mike's parents house, the dining room. Mike, Phoebe, Mike's parents 
  and the Angles are there.]
Phoebe: ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly 
  cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... 
  I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen 
  minutes.
Mike: Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that 
  one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
Phoebe: Oh, Pervert Parade?
Mike: (sighs) No...
Phoebe: Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?
Mike: Stop! (The butler serves dinner)
Phoebe: Oh God! Is that veal?
Mike: Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.
Bitsy: Oh!
Phoebe: Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I 
  mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...
Mike: Phoebe you don't have to eat...
Phoebe: No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, 
  fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat 
  running through it... (she cuts the meat, picks it up with her fork and holds 
  it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to overcome her vegetarian 
  thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... Clearly not enjoying the meat...) 
  Hmmm... yummy (everybody seems okay with it, except Mike. He's making a hmmmm.... 
  face... Then Phoebe swallows it) Hmmm... (at first she likes it, but then, in 
  an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. You 
  hear a door slamming.)
Mike: So...? What do you think? (looks at his parents, which 
  look in disgust)
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Monica switches off the VCR. Joey and Chandler 
  are behind the couch.]
Monica: So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Chandler: Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn 
  star!
Monica: That tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) 
  Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private. 

Joey: (laughs) Monica, look... I don't think you and I have 
  any secrets anymore... (Monica keeps looking at Joey) Not ready to joke about 
  it yet, okay, I see you later. (Joey walks out)
Monica: Why in the world would you take this tape and and 
  why would you watch it?
Chandler: Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature 
  man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd 
  be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and 
  moustaches.
Monica: Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
Chandler: This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not 
  over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Monica: Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that 
  is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
Chandler: Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a 
  moustache!
Monica: Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each 
  other. That's all that matters.
Chandler: Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling 
  around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
Monica: Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole 
  life! (she turns on the video again)
Chandler: Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how 
  it ends.
Monica: THAT'S NOT ME!
Chandler: What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 
  'em cowgirl!
Monica: That bastard taped over me! (Chandler's expression 
  changes)
Chandler: Is that a problem? 
Monica: I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank 
  tape, Doctor!
[Scene: Mike's parents house. Dining room again. Both Mike and Phoebe are not 
  at the table, but the others still are.]
Theodore: I can't imagine what he sees in her.
Bitsy: She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife 
  of his. (Mike walks in) Oh, hello dear...
Mike: Hey, what's going on?
Bitsy: We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?
Mike: A little better.
Bitsy: By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? 
  Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.
Theodore: You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well 
  behaved and... single.
Mike: I'm not interested.
Bitsy: Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all 
  the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real...
Mike: All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight 
  is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, 
  but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...
Bitsy: Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth! (Phoebe almost enters 
  the room, but she hears the discussion and waits and evesdrops next to the door-opening.)
Mike: So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't 
  bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept 
  the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...
Bitsy: The woman you what? (Phoebe overheard what Michael 
  said and now enters the room)
Phoebe: Yeah... The woman you what?
Mike: The woman I love... (he walks to Phoebe) I love you... 
  Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my 
  parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've 
  ever met in my life...
Phoebe: I love you too... 
Mike: You do?
Phoebe: YEAH...! How great is this...? (they kiss)
Mike: Wanna get out of here?
Phoebe: Okay.
Mike: Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.
Phoebe: I had a great time. (accent) It was really top drawer. 
  And here's something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in 
  the coat closet... Ta taaa...
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's. Emma is in her bed and Ross and Rachel are rapping 
  and dancing for her.]
Ross: She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.
Rachel: So fellas
Ross: Yeah!
Rachel: fellas
Ross: Yeah!
Rachel: has your girlfriend got the butt?
Ross: Hell yeah!
Rachel: So shake it! (Rachel slaps Ross's butt on 
  the beat)
Ross: Shake it!
Rachel: Shake it!  (Phoebe, Mike, Chandler, Monica 
  and Joey step in)
Ross: Shake it!
Rachel: Shake that nasty butt...
Ross: Baby got back (Then Ross turns around and sees 
  their friends standing in the doorway)
Rachel: One more time from the top... I like big butts 
  and I cannot lie, you other br... (She also turns and sees the gang)
Ross: Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!

908 - The One With Rachel's Other Sister



908 - The One With Rachel's Other Sister 

[Scene: Monica and Chandlers apartment.]
Monica: Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
Chandler: Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our
  wedding china today?
Monica: No, I think we should save our china for something
  really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Chandler: Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint. 
Monica: What if something gets broken, they're so expensive. 
Chandler: What is the point of having them if we never use
  them?
Monica: Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen
  comes over..
Chandler: I will explain it to her.
Monica: <laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you
  talk to the queen. 
Joey: wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those
  horses can crap. 
TV announcer: Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.
Chandler: Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo
  hoo!
  TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap
  Days of Our Lives .
<Joey's eyes become large and he stands up>
Joey: Oh my God!
Chandler: Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime
  soap Days of Our Lives? 
Joey: Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I
  can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. 
<Chandler grabs Joey's left arm and pushes the sleeve up>
<Joey looks>
  Oh! Stupid long sleeves. 
Chandler: What are you going to do?
Joey: I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really
  good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.
  They sat us all down yesterday and said ""Everyone has to be there at 6:00
  AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani."" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot. 
Chandler: Well you proved them wrong.
Joey nods: Yeah.
<Chandler nods and his eyes get big like he's saying 'what the hell'>
Opening Credits

Ross: A lot of people are thankful for those.
< knock on door> 
Woman at door: Hello? Rachel?

  says> 
  Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Amy: Do you have a hair straightener? 
Rachel: Um... hi.
Amy: oh... hi.. <goes to Rachel with open arms>
Rachel: Aw. 
<Amy grabs her arms>
Amy: Hair Straightener?
Rachel: I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
Amy: Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed.
Rachel: Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby. 
Amy: I decorated Dad's office. 
Rachel: Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your
  vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing.
Amy: Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really
  need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house. 
<Amy bending over fiddling with her purse when Emma cries and she hears
  Emma>
Amy: Oh my God!

Amy: Is this Emmett? <pointing to EMMA>
Rachel: Uh.... its Emma.
Amy: Its a girl?
<Ross comes out of the bedrooms>
Ross: Hey Amy. 
Rachel: Oh Amy, you remember Ross.
Amy: Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy
  she used to date.
Ross: That was me.
Amy: No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had
  this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade. 
Ross with a look of wondering how long this is going to go on on his face:
  Still me.
Amy: No, I'm not talking about you. <to Rachel> It
  was your fat 
  friends brother with that bad afro, do you remember?
Ross starts talking over her 'do you remember' line: Amy. I'm going to save
  you some time, ok. <spins finger around in circle> All me. 
Monica and Chandler's Apartment.
<Joey is walking around looking worried. >
Monica: Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful.
  CAREFUL! 
<Chandler is startled and nearly drops the plates.> Sorry.
Chandler: I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives,
  I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute
  this isn't the china we picked out.. 
Monica: I know, after you left the store, I chose different
  ones.
Chandler: Why?
Monica: well no offense honey, but your taste is a little
  feminine for me.
Chandler: Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
< Phoebe comes in>
Phoebe: Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
Joey: Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to
  come over> 
Phoebe: Hey, what's going on Joe? 
Joey: I.. I.. I need a good lie.
Phoebe: Oh okay. How about the whole ""man walking on
  the moon"" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people! 
Joey: No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't
  at a work thing today.
Phoebe: Ooh, honey. You stink at lying. 
Joey: I do not.
Phoebe: Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday
  at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin
  was gone-who took it?
Joey: Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a
  raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey
  don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. <pause> He said.. ""Joey
  you stink at lying."" What am I going to do? 
Phoebe: Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good
  lie. I'll help you practice it.
Joey: Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you. 
Phoebe: Sure, what.. what was the work thing? 
Joey: Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls
  up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>
Phoebe: ""Pick up grandma at the airport""?
Joey: Oh.. man..
Ross and Rachel's Apartment. 
Amy with straight hair: Oh she's precious. Do you ever worry she's going to
  get your real nose? 
Rachel: Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs
  Ross' hand for support>
<Amy's cell phone rings> 
Amy: Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. <to Ross and Rachel> Can
  I take this upstairs? 
Ross: Sure, we don't live there but...
Amy: Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? <moves hands
  around motioning 'just these rooms'> <To Ross> I thought you were
  a doctor. 
Rachel: Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
Amy: Ew. <walks into Rachel's room, I'm guessing>
Rachel: God she is unbelievable.
Ross: I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
Rachel: Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a
  restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush. 
Amy storms out: Stupid Thanksgiving.
Rachel: What? What happened? 
Amy: My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find
  a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then
  his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married
  guys. 
Ross: Don't say that.
Amy: Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to
  be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi. 
Rachel: Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.¬† Um.. Ross, could I talk
  to you in private?
Ross: Sure, you want to go upstairs?
<Ross and Rachel go in the kitchen>
Rachel: Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I
  would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Ross: You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like
  the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Rachel: Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has
  no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I
  would like them to bond. 
Ross: Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I
  don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job. 
Rachel: Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just
  going to have to make our peace with that! 
<Rachel grabs Ross' hand for support and starts to cry a little>
Monica and Chandler's apartment
Rachel opens their door: Hi.
Everyone there says: Hi, hey.
Rachel: Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.¬† This is
  Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon. 
Everyone: Hi.
Amy: Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives. 
Joey laughs: Yeah.
Amy: wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you. 
Joey looks rejected: Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
<Joey turns away and Chandler reassuringly pats him on the back>
Ross to Monica: Hi.
Monica to Ross: Hi.
<they hug and kiss on check> 
Monica to Emma: Hey you.
Monica to Amy: So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're
  seeing Emma? 
Amy with confused look on face: Yeah I.. I think so. <sticks her hand out
  to shake hands with Phoebe and says to her> It's nice to meet you Emma. 
Phoebe shakes her hand and says: Phoe-Be.
Amy: Oh. That's a funny noise. 
<Monica and Amy turn away and walk into the living room towards the secret
  closet>
Joey: Pheebs, I still need some help here
Phoebe: Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.
  but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when
  you're talking, people know you're lying. 
Joey: Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..
  I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor. 
Phoebe looks down: You are a terrific actor. 
<Joey realizes what she's doing>
Amy coming out of the bathroom: Hey. Hey where's the baby?
Rachel: Oh we just put her down for a nap.
Amy: Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible?
  If you guys died. 
Ross first has a look of 'huh' then changes it to sarcastic happy: Thank you
  Amy. 
Amy: no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it
  would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her,
  then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then
  I'd get married. 
Phoebe: Thats a great movie. <she claps>
<Joey nods in agreement>
Amy: Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything
  cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just
  not really a big fan of Emily. [Transcriber note: I'm surprised that Rachel
  and Ross didn't say they weren't either here]
Ross: Emma. 
Amy turns around to Phoebe: Emma, Ross wants you. 
Phoebe: PHOE-BE.
Amy turns to Ross and Rachel: Why does she keep making that
  noise? 
Rachel: Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,
  if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock
  on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby. 
Amy: Well who would?
Ross: Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would
  want Monica and Chandler. 
Chandler: I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma. 
Monica: yeah oh my god, I'm so moved. 
Amy: I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die
  and I don't get your baby? 
Rachel: See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.
  We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected
  to the baby.
Amy: Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's¬† a lump. 
Chandler: You know, guys I got to say. This means so much
  to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica
  and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts
  about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts
  to cry>
Amy: <points to Chandler> This guy? Seriously? 
Later in the day.
Monica: Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using
  our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
Ross starts playing with a plate: Woah. Woah... <nearly really drops the
  plate and more seriously> Woah. 
Monica: Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will
  not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>
Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
Joey: Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?
  Do you not trust me with a fancy plate? 
Monica: No, honey, its. thats a special plate.¬† See
  its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. 
Joey: I can't believe I won.
Amy: Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you
  would give your baby to these strangers over me.
Rachel: Monica is Ross' sister. 
Amy: No, Ross' sister was really fat. 
Monica: That was me. 
Amy: No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that
  used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog. 
Rachel: Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.
<Amy gets pissed and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very harshly,
  you can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate> 
Monica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you're having a little
  bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I
  mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this. 
<Monica holds a turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat
  off with a knife>
Monica: Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets
  face it you have fun. 
Amy: Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate
  lady dies, then do I get the baby?
Chandler: No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated
  at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
<Ross and Rachel pause and ponder this> 
Rachel: Well actually...
Chandler: Actually what? 
Ross: well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma
  would go to my parents. 
Chandler: What?
Amy: Hurts, doesn't it? 
<Chandler gives a look that says ""Yeah!"">
Joey raises his hand: Uh.. who has to die for me to get her? 
<Everyone is looking around and at Joey with looks of 'what?' on their
  faces>
Commercial Break.
Chandler: So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough
  to raise Emma? 
Ross looks down: No,¬† that that is not what we're saying.
Joey: Yeah he's lying. He looked down. 
<Joey looks to Phoebe and she nods in agreement>
Chandler: Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?
  Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! 
Rachel: Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think
  you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent. 
Ross: Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like
  Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict. 
Monica: Thats not how you see me, is it? 
Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun. 
Chandler: Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do
  you really think I'm not capable? 
Ross: No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're
  strongest when.. when you're together. 
Chandler: Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks
  on table>¬† she'd have to give her up. 
Ross: Sure, Monica would have to give her up. 
Joey: I lie better then that, right?
Chandler: So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends
  die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left
  in my life gets taken away from me?
Phoebe: There's your movie! <claps> 
Later on.
Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway. 
Monica: Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner. 
Chandler: Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise
  poorly? 
Monica: Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.
  I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of
  Merlot and a five year old condom. 
Chandler: Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong
  father figure and I never will be. 
Monica: No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Chandler: Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said
  was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody
  knows it. 
Monica: I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because
  I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard
  parts. 
Chandler: Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go
  to your room! You're grounded""? 
Monica: Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?
Chandler: You said that to me last week. 
Monica: How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. 
Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment.
Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad.
Joey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message
  on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed
  off at me.. <whiny voice> And they all got to meet Santa! 
Phoebe: It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's
  easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the
  parade because you had a family emergency. 
Joey: Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because
  I had a family emergency.
Phoebe: Ooh, what happened? 
Joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear: Oh.. My sister's
  raccoon.
Phoebe: No! Nothing with a raccoon. 
Joey: Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands
  out in the air>
Monica and Chandler come through the front door.
Monica: Oh wait.. What are you doing? 
Joey: Setting the table. 
Phoebe: Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy
  china for dessert too. 
Monica: Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses
  on my wedding dress. 
Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying
  thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.
Ross: Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
Chandler: Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't
  know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I
  want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. 
Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok.
Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch.¬† <pauses> Uchh <louder
  this time> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you. 
Rachel: UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>
Amy: You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.
Rachel: Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when
  I died and didn't give you my baby?
Amy: This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I
  mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer. 
Rachel: What? What carrer? 
Amy: Um.. I'm a decorator. 
Rachel: Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a
  decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear. 
Amy: Why can't you ever be supportive? 
Rachel: Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even
  come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby. 
Amy: Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in
  the hospital when I was getting my lips done. 
Rachel: I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks
  into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving
  Emily to you.
Ross: Emma. 
Rachel turns to Ross: Oh whose side are you on? <back
  to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle
  the responibility of a child. 
Amy: How hard could it be? You do it. 
Joey: ooh oooh.. 
Amy: Do you want to know why you don't want¬† me to have
  the baby? 
Rachel: uh huh.
Amy: Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have
  always been jealous of me. 
Rachel: Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You,
  your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings? 
Amy: Uh.. To name a few.¬† You know.. You know.. You've
  just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't
  have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do
  you even realize how much that hurt me? 
Rachel: Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Amy: Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.
Rachel: I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here
  today.
Amy: Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called
  sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.
Rachel: ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's
  forty five. 
Amy: You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your
  new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns
  throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something.
  Your baby isn't even that cute. 
<everyone sucks their breath in, in shock>
Ross walks over: Too far, Amy. Too far. 
Rachel: You take that back.
Amy: No. 
Rachel: Take it back!
Amy: No! What are you going to do? Make me?
Rachel: Heey man, I work out. 
<Ross nods his head and points at her, in a yes manner> 
Amy: So do I.
Rachel: I do pilates. 
Amy: I do yoga.
Rachel: Bring it on! 
<Amy pushes Rachel and Monica goes berserk and runs around the table> 
Monica: Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the
  boxes! 
Rachel: Did you just push me?
Amy: Uh, yeah I think I did. 
Rachel: Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back> 
Monica screaming at Ross: Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't
  time! 
<Rachel and Amy 'fighting'.. They're really just trying to slap each other
  and just keep slapping their hands> 
Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!! 
<They go back to fighting and then it really gets on>
Phoebe: Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
Joey: What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello
  on them. 
<Amy starts spitting on Rachel's hand and Rachel is saying ew and pushes
  her away> 
Rachel: Ew! Gross. 
<Amy runs towards Rachel and Rachel puts her arm out, hand on Amy's head
  and Amy starts trying to hit her but is missing, Rachel is moving backwards
  towards the table when her hand swipes the one plate left on the table on to
  the floor>
<Everyone is shocked and Monica faints and Ross catches her> 
Chandler: Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and
  you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't
  be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones
  I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize
  to her right now. 
Amy: I'm sorry.
Rachel: Mon, I'm so sorry. 
Chandler: Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize
  to each other and mean it. 
Amy and Rachel at same time: Sorry.
Chandler: By the way, that fight was totally arousing. 
Ross: Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel
  dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma. 
Chandler: Oh yeah? Well thanks. 
Ross: So, so now do I get Joey?
Chandler: Okay, but you should know he eats five times a
  day and shoves pennies up his nose. 
<Ross ponders that and walks away>
Rachel: Are you okay Mon? 
Monica: uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a
  plate. Its not like somebody died. 
Phoebe: It's all right. You can mourn. 
Monica starts crying: Thank you. It was so beautiful. <gets up and walks
  towards the front door> I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies. 
Joey: Actually its not pies, its just pie. 
Monica: I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my
  god. I've lost the will to scold. 
Rachel: Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm
  sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.. 
Amy: So you're going to give me the baby?
Rachel: Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren
  discount. 
Amy starting to cry: You are not going to regret this. 
<they hug and Rachel has this disgusted look on her face and then Emma
  starts crying> 
Rachel: She needs changing.
Chandler: Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent
  and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there
  Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of
  china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Chandler is packing the broken china in its box. He's taping up the
  top of box so thoroughly, there isn't an inch of cardboard which isn't covered
  in tape. He is struggling with the tape dispenser.]
Phoebe: Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
Chandler: Nope...
Phoebe: Broke them all, huh?
Chandler: Yep...
Phoebe: You gonna tell her?
Chandler: Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna...
  put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should
  use these plates again for a looong time.
Monica: Like only if the queen comes?
Chandler: Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)
Joey: Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had
  a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie
  Pheebs.
Phoebe: No problem! Next week: stealing... (Chandler walks
  away to store the box of broken china.)
Monica: Bye plates!
Joey: Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (Chandler
  walks back, looking angrily at Joey)
Monica: What? Something happened with the plates?
Joey: Uhm... (looks down) Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came
  in...

Friends
The One With Christmas In Tulsa


Aired: 12/12/2002
Written by: Doty Abrams
Directed by: Kevin S. Bright
Transcribed by: Stephan Hoffmeister


[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, everyone's there; Phoebe recites the last verse of a poem to Joey. This poem is known as ""The Night Before Christmas"" by Clement Clarke Moore, but it seems that it's rather ""Account of a visit from St. Nicholas"" by Henry Livingston.]
Phoebe: ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, ""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!""
Joey: (impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
Phoebe: (smiling) Uh-huh.
Chandler: (coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Monica: I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Ross: You're really not coming back?
Chandler: Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
Monica: It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
Chandler: So, who does?
Phoebe: Oh, I like my job.
Joey: I *love* my job.
Rachel: Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
Ross: I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Chandler: I'm sorry, I won't be here.
Monica: It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
Chandler: Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.
Monica: (shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Chandler: Did I not mention that?
Monica: No!
Chandler: (thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)
*Opening Credits*
[Scene: Chandler's Office in Tulsa, in the conference room. Chandler's staff/co-workers are sitting round the table; Chandler is walking around, when he notices a piece of paper attached to the back of his chair.]
Chandler: All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing ""Screw you, Mr. Bing!"" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
(Wendy enters the conference room, carrying a cardboard box.)
Wendy: Hey!
Others: Hey.
Chandler: Hey. Where've you been?
Wendy: I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham. (She turns the cardboard box upside down over the conference table, a big piece of ham falls out.)
Chandler: (to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
Claudia: My kid's in a play right now.
Chandler: Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
Ken: (reading off his card) ""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet"".
Chandler: Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
Wendy: *Now* it feels like Christmas.
Chandler: I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
Ken: You can come to my house!
Chandler: Haha, no thanks!
Wendy: That was a nice pep-talk.
Chandler: Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
Wendy: So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
Chandler: Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
[Flashback to 410 - TOW The Girl From Poughkeepsie]
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is singing her holiday song.]
Phoebe: So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. (singing:)
""Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. Now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. No, don't sing along.
Monica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!""
Happy holidays, everybody!
[Flashback to 610 - TOW The Routine]
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment, Chandler is there. Phoebe and Rachel enter.]
Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Chandler: I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Phoebe: Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Rachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler: What? That's terrible!
Phoebe: No-no, we do it every year!
Chandler: Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
Phoebe: No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Rachel: Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Chandler: No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Phoebe: Oh no, we have to!
Chandler: No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Phoebe: Well then, you should look with us.
Chandler: Why?
Rachel: Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Chandler: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Phoebe: Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah.
Rachel: Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Chandler: If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Rachel: That's right!
(Phoebe looks under the couch)
Phoebe: Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Rachel: Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
(Phoebe tips it upside down, and a shoe falls out)
Rachel: Oh.
Phoebe: Ooh, who's it for?
Rachel: (Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) ""Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you.""
[Flashback to 209 - TOW Phoebe's Dad]
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey and Chandler are giving out their Christmas presents out of a cardboard box from a case of motor oil.]
Joey: Rach, these are for you.
Rachel: Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Joey: No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Chandler: OK, Pheebs, your turn.
Phoebe: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Joey: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: You guuuyys.
Joey: And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Ross: You got me a cola drink?
Chandler: And, a lemon lime.
Ross: Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Chandler: And last but not least.
(Chandler and Joey give Monica a pack of condoms.)
Joey: They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
[Flashback to 710 - TOW The Holiday Armadillo]
[Scene: Monica, Chandler and Phoebe's, Ross is costumed as an Armadillo.]
Ross: Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
Ben: Cool!
Ross: Yeah!
Monica: Come on Ben.
(Monica and Ben sit down on the couch.)
Ross: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Chandler: (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Ben: Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)
Chandler: Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
Ross: What are you doing here, Santa?
Chandler: Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Ross: I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Chandler: What?
Monica: Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
(They walk to the kitchen; everyone is lowering their voices)
Ross: (to Chandler) What are you doing?
Chandler: You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Ross: Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
Chandler: Why?
Ross: Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Chandler: But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Ross: I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
Chandler: Fine, I'll give the suit back.
(Ross turns around and walks back to Ben.)
Monica: (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
Chandler: Santa? Really?
Monica: Yeah, is that okay?
Chandler: Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Monica: No.
Chandler: Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)
[Scene: Back in the conference room in Tulsa.]
Chandler: You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
(All others are looking up, surprised)
Chandler: Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
(All are leaving, wishing each other a Merry Christmas, peace on earth, etc. Only Wendy stays.)
Chandler: Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?
Wendy: Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
Chandler: Ah. Thanks.
Wendy: Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.
Chandler: Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.
[Scene change back an forth: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica's on the other end of the line. The phone's speaker is turned on, so the rest of the gang, sitting around the phone, can hear Chandler.]
Monica: Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Others: (simultaneously) Merry Christmas! (except for Phoebe...)
Phoebe: (simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
(All the others look at her, stunned/incredulous)
Chandler: Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Monica: So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Chandler: Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
Monica: Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
Chandler: It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Monica: Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
Chandler: I sent them home.
Monica: Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
Chandler: Uhh, uh...
Ross: (in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!
Chandler: I don't know!
Ross: (in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!
Chandler: I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
Monica: What does she do there?
Chandler: Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
Monica: She did WHAT?
Chandler: BE-LOW me!
Joey: Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
Monica: *What*??
Chandler: Well, she... she didn't win...
Monica: Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Chandler: Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
Rachel: (interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!
Chandler: Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
Monica: Okay.
Chandler: I'm serious!
Monica: Okay!
Chandler: Merry Christmas.
Monica: Merry Christmas.
Chandler: Merry Christmas, you guys!
Others: (simultaneously) Yeah, Merry... Christmas. (again, Phoebe...)
Phoebe: (simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab.
(Again the others just look at her, silent, puzzled.)
[Scene: back in the conference room in Tulsa]
Chandler: (hanging up the phone) The wife says ""Hi!"".
Wendy: Ah. Fun conversation?
Chandler: Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
Wendy: Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible? (She gets hold of Chandler's tie, slowly moving her hands upwards on the tie, getting closer and closer to him, seductive.)
Chandler: This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
(She's getting closer to him, the scene fades to black.)
[Scene: The conference room in Tulsa again, Chandler is trying to evade Wendy]
Chandler: Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)
Wendy: (laughs) ...Missy?
Chandler: I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Wendy: You are to me... (She gets closer again, putting her arms around his torso.)
Chandler: (flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!
Wendy: So? I'm married. (Showing him the ring on her finger.)
Chandler: I'm *happily* married.
Wendy: Oh. - What's *that* like?
Chandler: Right. So, I'm sorry...
Wendy: Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?
Chandler: Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
Wendy: Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?
(Chandler starts to think about it...)
[Flashback to 716 - TOW The Truth About London]
[Scene: London, Chandler's hotel room. He was getting ready for bed when Monica pays him a visit and they started talking]
Chandler: I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
Monica: Really?
Chandler: You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Monica: Well, not anymore.
Chandler: But we don't do that.
Monica: I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Chandler: How drunk are you?
Monica: Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Chandler: (thinks) That's the perfect amount!
Monica: Okay!
(They run to the bed, sit down, and start making out again.)
Monica: (breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?
Chandler: What?
Monica: This doesn't feel weird!
Chandler: I know.
Monica: You're a really good kisser.
Chandler: Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
Monica: Hm-hmm!
Chandler: Okay!
(They do so and they take off their clothes.)
Monica: Wow! You are really fast!
Chandler: It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Monica: We're gonna see each other naked.
Chandler: Yep!
Monica: Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Chandler: Count of three?
Monica: One!
Chandler: Two!
Monica: Two!
Both: Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)
Chandler: Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Monica: Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Chandler: Eh! (They start making out again)
[Flashback to 503 - TOW The Triplets]
[Scene: A hallway in the hospital, Monica and Chandler are talking.]
Chandler: So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Monica: Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
Chandler: Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
Monica: I think you're better than you think you are.
Chandler: Really? Okay, so...
Monica: (interrupting) Know when to stop.
Chandler: Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Monica: Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around:) Don't do the dance.
Chandler: Right!
[Flashback to 524 - TOI Vegas, Part II]
[Scene: The Gift Shop, Monica and Chandler are entering.]
Monica: I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Chandler: Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Monica: You're so efficient. I love you!
Chandler: Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
Monica: No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
Chandler: Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
Monica: That'll work!
Chandler: I don't think so.
Monica: Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Chandler: (looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
Monica: That's stealing!
Chandler: No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
(She does so and it makes her look pregnant.)
Monica: Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
Chandler: Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
[Flashback to 702 - TOW Rachel's Book]
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as Monica enters.]
Monica: Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Chandler: Ehh.
Monica: Eh, you work for that.
Chandler: Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Monica: You do?!
Chandler: Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Monica: Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Chandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Monica: You thought about that?
Chandler: Yeah.
Monica: How many kids were we gonna have?
Chandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Monica: What else did you think about?
Chandler: Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Monica: (laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Chandler: Sure you do.
Monica: No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
Chandler: You sure?
Monica: Uh-hmm.
Chandler: I love you so much.
Monica: I love you. (They kiss.)
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, everyone except Chandler is there; they're opening their presents]
Rachel: (opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I love it!
Ross: Really? You're not gonna return it?
Rachel: Well, not this second!
Phoebe: (at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
(The others all get up and go to the window.)
Rachel: Oh wow, it's so beautiful...
Ross: Wow, it really is!
(They all stand a moment in silence, staring out of the window.)
Monica: ""Wendy"" is a fat girl name.
Phoebe: Aren't we done with that?
Monica: Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
(Shortly after that, Chandler enters.)
Chandler: Hey!
(Surprised, uttering Ahhs and Ohhs, the others are coming over to him.)
Ross: Oh my god...
Joey: Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
Monica: What are you doing here?
Chandler: I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Joey: Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
Chandler: Monica.
Joey: Got ya. (blinks an eye)
Chandler: I never want to leave you again!
Monica: But I thought if you left, you get fired.
Chandler: Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Monica: What?
Ross: What, you, you really quit your job?
Chandler: Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
Rachel: What do you really want to do?
Chandler: (realizing) I have *not* thought this through!
Monica: Oh my god!
Chandler: I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
Monica: No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
Chandler: Thanks!
Phoebe: Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
Chandler: (flattered) Ahh...
Phoebe: Now give me my real gift.
(Chandler hands Phoebe an envelope, and some more to Monica)
Phoebe: (to Chandler) Thank you.
Chandler: (to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)
(Monica passes the Envelopes on to Ross, Joey and Rachel.)
Ross: Oh, hey...
(They all open their envelopes.)
Ross: (reading off his card) ""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet."" -- How did you know?
Rachel: Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
Chandler: I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Joey: Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Chandler: I don't have a *job*!
*Closing Credits*
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica is cleaning up, Chandler is sitting on the couch, checking the Job offers in a Newspaper.]
Chandler: Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
Monica: You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
(Chandler looks at the bill, thinking... then looks at the offer in the Newspaper and makes some dancing moves to see if he's up for the job...)

FRIENDS - THE ONE WHERE RACHEL GOES BACK TO WORK






FRIENDS - THE ONE WHERE RACHEL GOES BACK TO WORK
Teleplay by: Peter Tibbals
Story by: Judd Rubin
Directed by: Gary Halvorson

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's]
Chandler: Hey!
Monica: Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. 
You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
Chandler: I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
Monica: Well, I just lost my erection.
Chandler: I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself? 
Monica: You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
Chandler: But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start. 
Monica: Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, 
and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files! 
Chandler: Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Monica: I know!!! My erection is back!

[Opening credits]
[Scene: Central Perk]
Joey: (To Gunther who comes over with coffee and a muffin) Thank you!
Phoebe: Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
Joey: Okay.
Phoebe Thank you. (Pours his coffee in a thermos and puts his muffin in her purse.) Thank you! 
Joey:: Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?
Phoebe: I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash. 
Joey: If you want I could loan you some money?
Phoebe: Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.
Joey: Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
Phoebe: You could do that?
Joey: Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need. 
Phoebe: Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
Joey: Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.
Phoebe: Oh, really?
Joey: No it is awesome!
(Rachel and Ross enter with Emma)
Ross: Hi guys.
All: (Adlib hellos)
Phoebe: Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?
Ross: Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Joey: She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
Rachel: Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
Ross: I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts.
Can I get a blue bow?
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's]
Monica: (Flipping through bunch of folders as Chandler enters from bathroom) Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, 
photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
Chandler: How long was I in there?
Monica: Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
Chandler: Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Monica: Don't you want to look through the rest?
Chandler: I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
Monica: You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
Chandler: I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your 
cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?""
Monica: I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best.""
Chandler: Honey? Leave it to the pros.
Monica: I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. 
Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
Chandler: ""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.""
Monica: ""Marriage. It's not for everybody.""
[Scene: Ralph Lauren]
Rachel: That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl. 
Ross: Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread. 
Rachel: I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . (To the guy behind her desk) Who the hell are you!?
Guy: Who the hell are you?
Rachel: I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Ross: Good one, Rach.
Guy: I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.
Rachel: Excuse me?
Gavin: Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?
[Scene: DOOL set]
Phoebe: Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!
Joey: Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. 
So, are you excited about your scene?
Phoebe: Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous. 
Joey: Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.
Director: Okay, okay, okay! (To Phoebe) You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. 
You're gonna move on ""action!"" You're gonna walk over to the operating table. You're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put
the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't doddle.
Phoebe: Okay, now. What?
Director: And...Action!!
(Phoebe starts walking toward the operating table. Her hands are shaking like crazy, causing the tray to rattle.)
Director: Cut! Cut!
Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
Director: Well, don't be.
Phoebe: Okay, that helps.
Director: And...Action!
(Phoebe starts walking towards the table again. She's even more shaky than before and almost drops the tray.)
Director: Cut!
Joey: Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! (Off the director's look) Alright, eight.
Director: And...Action!
(Ok, here we go again. Phoebe starts walking toward the operating table, but stops every time the tray starts to rattle. She eventually drops it on the floor, but finishes the scene anyway by putting the now non-existent tray on the table.)
[Scene: Central Perk]
Interviewer: So, do you have any other question about advertising?
Chandler: No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.""
Interviewer: Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency. 
Chandler: Really? That's great!
Interviewer: It's an unpaid internship.
Chandler: It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid.""
Interviewer: Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.
Chandler: Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. 
Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
Interviewer: Stop!
Interviewer: Okay.
[Scene: Ralph Lauren]
Rachel: Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?
Gavin: Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.
Rachel: A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
Gavin: Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.
Rachel: Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. 
I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office. 
Gavin: I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.
Rachel: Excuse me?
Ross: Rach we have a code brown situation.
Rachel: Can you please, please take care of it for me?
Ross: Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
Rachel: Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
Gavin: Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.
Rachel: That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp. 
Gavin: I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.
Rachel: Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?
Gavin: Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.
Rachel: Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Mr. Zelner: (Enters) Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
Rachel: Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.
Mr. Zelner: Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, 
Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin!
Rachel: That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?
Gavin: Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.
Rachel: (To herself) Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.
Mr. Zelner: Incidentally, when are you coming back?
Rachel: Today.
Gavin: You said two weeks.
Rachel: No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.
[Scene: DOOL set]
Joey: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey. So, what did he say?
Joey: Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" 
Okay, so he said: ""If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass.""
Phoebe: I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
Joey: That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray. 
Phoebe: Joey.
Joey: No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she
carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!
Phoebe: Who dies?
Joey: (Points to man on operating table) Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
Phoebe: Yes, doctor.
Joey: Okay.
Director: Okay, let's try this one more time. 
Phoebe: Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!
Director: And...Action!
Phoebe: (Does the scene) Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?
Director: The rest of the scene.
Phoebe: Okay, from the top, people!
[Scene: Ralph Lauren]
Rachel: Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, 
they were gonna fire me.
Ross: What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Rachel: Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now
this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out. 
Ross: What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
Rachel: I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
Ross: Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Rachel: Come on, I don't know what else to do.
Ross: Fine, fine. (To Emma) We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will. (Gives her a kiss, and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)
Rachel: Ross?
Ross: Huh?
Rachel: You're pretty.
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's] 
Chandler: Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. 
Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
Ross: So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Chandler: Yeah. 
Ross: (Hugs Chandler) Good-bye.
Monica: (Enters) Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. (Sees Ross) Didn't see you there Geller. 
Chandler: Yeah, Ross is here so...
Ross: Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
Monica: We're gonna have sex.
Ross: I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Monica: Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
Ross: Pants off Bing!
[Scene: Ralph Lauren]
Rachel: Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?
Gavin: Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.
Rachel: Hey, they were popular when I left!
Gavin: Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
Rachel: Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?
Gavin: That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?
Rachel: Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, 
and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!
Gavin: Fine. 
Rachel: (Sits down in her chair) Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
Gavin: Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.
Rachel: Fine, I will. (Pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it ""collapse"") Alright, fill me in! 
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's]
Ross: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Ross: You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Chandler: Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete 
and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Monica: (Enters from the bedroom) Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
Ross: Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Monica: (To Ross) Sorry. (To Chandler) But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Chandler: Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant. 
Monica: What are you talking about?
Chandler: That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Monica: What!? You faked it?
Ross: You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual (He leaves.)
[Scene: DOOL set]
Phoebe: Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
Joey: Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay. 
Phoebe: Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress?
That's gonna confuse my fans. 
Joey: Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
Phoebe: Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.
Joey: Nice.
Phoebe: Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
Joey: No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight. 
Phoebe: About what?
Joey: He slept with you and then never called you.
Phoebe: And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
Director: Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!
Man: So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
Joey/Drake: I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.
(Phoebe walks by and slaps him.)
Director: Cut, cut! What are you doing!?
Phoebe: Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
Extra: Me too!
Another extra: Me too!
Joey: Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's]
Gavin: (Enters) Wow, you're here already.
Rachel: Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but
I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
Gavin: How do you fix the chair?
Rachel: Except that! (Mr. Zelner enters) Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
Mr. Zelner: Good, because it's in ten minutes.
Rachel: What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.
Mr. Zelner: Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going
helicopter shopping.
Rachel: Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, 
no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!
Gavin: You can do the presentation.
Rachel: No, I can't, I have a baby.
Gavin: I'll watch her.
Rachel: Why would you do that?
Gavin: Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.
Rachel: That's really nice.
Gavin: I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
Rachel: Then you're not gonna like what's coming. (Starts crying) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
Gavin: I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children. (To Emma) Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you. 
[Scene: DOOL set]
Joey: Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
Director: Okay, okay. But this is her last chance. 
Joey: Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?
Joey: Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, 
you just wait on the tables?
Phoebe: I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
Joey: You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
Phoebe: Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened. 
Joey: What?
Phoebe: Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus
from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
Joey: (To the director) Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's]
Monica: You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!
Chandler: Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises. 
Monica: Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
Chandler: That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby,
I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
Monica: Like a month?
Chandler: Or a year?
Monica: Really, you want to wait a year?
Chandler: It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts, but longer."" (Pause)
It'll probably be more than a year. 
Monica: I really wanna have a baby.
Chandler: Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back. 
Monica: No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
Chandler: I quit and you learn what I do?
Monica: It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. 
I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. 
There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons. 
Chandler: I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby. 
Monica: It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. 
I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? 
Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? 
Where will all the ribbons go!?!
Chandler: Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
Monica: Yes, please!
Chandler: Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
Monica: I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
[Closing credits][Scene: DOOL set]
Joey/Drake: I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. 
I don't care if you are my brother.
Man: I'm not your brother.
Phoebe/Waitress: What about my children Drake?! Huh!? (She starts running around on the set with a security guy chasing her) No!! No!! No! God!

  Directed by: Ben Weiss
  Transcribed by: Roni Raab

[Scene: Coffee place, Joey is there, Chandler is entering]
Chandler: Hey
Joey: Hey. So where's Mon?
Chandler: Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
Joey: And you're not helping?
Chandler: I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice 
  - not helping.
(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma in Rachel's hands)
Ross: Hey you guys!
Joey and Chandler: (start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ...
Rachel: Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Ross: Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points 
  to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Joey and Chandler: Hi.
Molly: Hi.
(Emma starts to cry)
Ross: Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
Joey: You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
Rachel: Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
Molly: No, you stay, I'll do it (takes Emma from Rachel). 
Rachel: OK, thank you.
Molly: Nice to meet you guys (to Chandler and Joey).
Joey: Yeah, you too.
(Molly leaves)
Rachel: Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
Ross: Yeah.
Chandler: Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
Rachel: What? You really think she's hot?
Chandler: Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Rachel: And Joey?
Joey: How do you think she's doing?
Rachel: Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Ross: Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Rachel: Thank you! (goes to get coffee)
Chandler: Now that Rachel's gone?
Rachel: So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their 
  hands)
OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Mike and Phoebe in Phoebe's place, Phoebe is doing a crossword puzzle]
Phoebe: Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
Mike: Lima.
Phoebe: No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". Helpfully 
  with a ""to"" in the middle.
Mike: You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS ""vtox"". 
  (opens the kitchen cabinet) Oh god! Oh!
Phoebe: What?
Mike: OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a 
  rat in your cupboard.
Phoebe: (relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
Mike: What, is he your pet rat?
Phoebe: Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who 
  I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on 
  the plate of cookies.
Mike: You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, 
  and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
Phoebe: What are those?
Mike: I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get 
  rid of it!
Phoebe: OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
Mike: Thank you.
Phoebe: So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. 
  (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)
[Scene: Rachel's office, Rachel comes in and Gavin is there]
Rachel: Hello.
Gavin: Hello
Rachel: Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma 
  yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
Gavin: For what?
Rachel: Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous 
  and arrogant and obnoxious ...
Gavin: Is this your first appology?
Rachel: No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And 
  I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
(Heather walks in)
Heather: Good morning! 
Rachel: Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, 
  I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, 
  obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 
  'till it's finished.
Gavin: What?
Rachel: I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
Gavin: I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her 
  skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
Rachel: Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
Gavin: Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
Rachel: Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at 
  my ass"". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just 
  think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your 
  subordinate.
Gavin: I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
Rachel: That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know 
  that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had 
  a deap meaningful relationship.
Gavin: Huh. What's Tag's last name?
Rachel: It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last 
  name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.
Gavin: But it was a deap meaningful relationship.
Rachel: Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely 
  right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name 
  was Morgan! Huh!
Gavin: It was Jones.
Rachel: Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
[Scene: Coffee place, Molly holding Emma and talking to Joey]
Joey: Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
Molly: You mean, when you were a baby.
Joey: Sure.
(Chandler is staring at Molly)
Monica: Would you stop staring at her?
Chandler: I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Monica: What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind 
  of way.
Ross: Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there 
  in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me 
  feel like I earned it.
Chandler: Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Monica: Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl 
  for once.
Molly: (to Ross) I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
Ross: Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you 
  - wovyou dovyou ...
Molly: Bye
Monica: They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
Molly: I think it's sweet. (goes to leave)
Ross, Joey and Chandler: Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
Rachel: (to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if 
  you didn't go after her.
Joey: Why not?
Rachel: Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything 
  to, you know, drive her away.
Joey: So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call 
  her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds 
  about right.
Ross: Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just 
  forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
Joey: Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told 
  me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
Ross: What are you, a child?
Joey: Yes!
Ross: Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy 
  on someone else.
Joey: Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)
Monica: (to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)
[Scene: Phoebe's place, Phoebe and Mike are there]
Phoebe: Hey Mikey
Mike: Hey P
Phoebe: What are you doing?
Mike: Setting rat traps.
Phoebe: To kill Bob??
Mike: No, no, to test his neck strength.
Phoebe: No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna 
  capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can 
  maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
Mike: Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
Phoebe: I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at 
  cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! 
  Bob's a mom!
Mike: Better think of a new name for him.
Phoebe: I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
Mike: I don't know, I mean I'm not sure (they hear cracking voice from 
  somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap) ...
Phoebe: Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Mike: Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Phoebe: Suzie? (Runs over there to check)
[Scene: Mon and Chan's, Ross enters]
Ross: Whazzup??
Chandler: Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Ross: Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep 
  an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Chandler: You don't trust him?
Ross: Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked 
  for her daughter, the ""hot nanny"".
Chandler: Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? 
  Because I could get a job any day now.
Ross: You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm 
  sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do 
  this for me?
Chandler: Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know 
  as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, 
  he's going to have sex with it.
Ross: Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause) 

Chandler: Picturing that tree?
Ross: I am, yes.
[Scene: Hallway, Joey get out of his appartment and Chandler jumps out of 
  his]
Chandler: Where you going, Joe?
(Joey falls on floor and gets up)
Joey: For a walk.
Chandler: Oh. You mind if I join you?
Joey: Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize 
  my thoughts.
Chandler: Your thoughts? Plural?
Joey: Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta 
  see her!
Chandler: I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Joey: Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! 
  She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable 
  boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over 
  there?
Chandler: Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Joey: Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the 
  world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Chandler: Great novels? 
Joey: Fine ... mediocre porn
[Scene: Rachel's office, Rachel and Gavin there, phone rings, Gavin picks 
  it up]
Gavin: Gavin Mitchelle's office.
Rachel: Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) 
  Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll 
  pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)
Gavin: Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary. (Rachel is upset)
Rachel: Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
Gavin: Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. (hangs up) (to Rachel) Yes?
Rachel: If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
Gavin: Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your 
  pad three hours ago. (Rachel throws away that paper) Man, I really bug you, 
  don't I?
Rachel: Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, 
  from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to 
  you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now.
(door knock, Monica enters)
Monica: Hey Rach!
Rachel: Hi!
Monica: Ready for your birthday lunch?
Rachel: Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce 
  you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin 
  Mitchelle. 
Gavin: Pleased to meet you.
Monica: Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Rachel: Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his 
  mother. 
Gavin: Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday. 
  (leaves)
Rachel: Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
Monica: You were just being so nice to him!
Rachel: I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
(A man walks by)
Rachel: Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
Monica: Right there! That was so fake!
Rachel: Shh!
[Scene: Rachel's birthday party]
Rachel: (to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the 
  last person I want to see.
Monica: Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
Rachel: God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy 
  hates me.
Monica: Does he?
Rachel: What?
Monica: Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first 
  grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly 
  had a crush on me?
Rachel: Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet 
  to see if he can knock you over.
Molly: (with Emma in a basinet) She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
Rachel: Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys 
  see in her?
Monica: Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)
(Joey comes over)
Joey: Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Rachel: Yeah, sure!
Joey: Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you 
  later (runs after Molly)
Monica: Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
Rachel: Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the 
  box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)
Phoebe: Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
Mike: Yeah. We have rat babies now.
Rachel: Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Monica: So this is what a stroke feels like.
Phoebe: I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility 
  now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're 
  a mother.
Rachel: Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Phoebe: No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed 
  them.
Rachel: whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
Phoebe: Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone 
  can afford help. (she and Mike leave)
(Ross gets out of the bathroom, sees Chandler)
Ross: Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Chandler: (In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Ross: We have to stop them before something happens!
Chandler: (still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the 
  door) 
[Scene: Ross's place, Molly and Joey are talking on the couch]
Joey: So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. 
  It takes a lot of hard work.
Molly: So where did you study?
Joey: Oh, I didn't go to college.
Molly: No, where did you study acting?
Joey: Molly ... people don't study acting ...
(Ross and Chandler walk in, Joey looks disappointed)
Ross: Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Molly: Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
Ross: Thanx.
(Molly gets up and walks away)
Joey: (upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??
Ross: What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Joey: No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. 
  What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? 
  Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, 
  and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this 
  way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
(pause)
Ross and Chandler: Come on! Joe!
Joey: Ok (admits)
(knock on door, Ross opens, it's a woman)
Woman: Hi, is Molly here?
Ross: Yeah, come on in. Molly?
Molly: (goes out of the room) Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha (they kiss on the lips 
  in a romantic way). (to Ross) I'll see you tomorrow.
Ross: Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have 
  no problem.
Joey: It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The 
  princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
[Scene: Phoebe's place, Phoebe and Mike enter]
Phoebe: Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing 
  the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
Mike: Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve 
  around their rats?
Phoebe: Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
Mike: Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate 
  and there are hundreds of them?
Phoebe: Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
Mike: Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a ""love 
  the one you're with"" kind of animals.
Phoebe: No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what 
  are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then 
  each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers) 
  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
Mike: Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let 
  the box of rats ruin our lives.
Phoebe: Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. 
  But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's 
  favorites. 
Mike: It's gonna be ok.
Phoebe: You must think I'm crazy.
Mike: No, I think you're sweet.
Phoebe: Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. 
  I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to 
  my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't 
  told you about that yet, have I?
[Scene: Rachel's party, Rachel is on the balcony, Monica goes there also]
Monica: Hey!
Rachel: Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Monica: No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
Rachel: Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Monica: Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from 
  your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).
Rachel: Mmm hmm.
Gavin: Yeah, hey. (comes in to the balcony)
Monica: Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
Rachel: No.
(Monica goes back inside)
Gavin: Nice party.
Rachel: Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks 
  at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...
Monica: (from inside) Again, you're welcome.
Gavin: Look, I'll just give you this and go.
Rachel: Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
Gavin: Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There 
  are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you 
  the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.
Rachel: Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens 
  the card). ""From Gavin""
Gavin: I really mean it.
Rachel: (opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
Gavin: You don't mind? (puts it around her neck) Well, what do you know, it fits!
Rachel: See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such 
  a hard time?
Gavin: I'm not sure.
Rachel: Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Gavin: I do have feelings for you.
Rachel: You do?
Gavin: Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
Rachel: See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion 
  of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)
[cut to Ross from his appartment, holding baby toys and is shocked to see 
  them kissing]
ENDING CREDITS
Chandler: (sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)
Phoebe: (walks in) Hey
Chandler: (normal voice) Hi
Phoebe: Listen, I think I've left something here.
Chandler: Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?
Phoebe: (likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of 
  my rat babies.
Chandler: Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
Monica: Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Ross, Monica and Phoebe are there as Chandler enters]
Chandler: (excited) Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what‚Ä¶

Joey: Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!

Monica: (shocked) Really? (She looks around, suddenly embarrassed) Let's get past the moment.

Phoebe: What's your news?

Chandler: Thank you. I got a job in advertising. (Everybody cheers)

Monica: (hugging Chandler) Oh, honey, that's incredible!

Phoebe: (inquisitive) Gosh, what's the pay like? (Everybody stares at her indignantly) Oh, come on people‚Ä¶ (defending) come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! (She looks at Joey) Hey Joey! (Joey winks at her)

Chandler: Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.

Joey: Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. 

Chandler: Right. So, it'll be the same except‚Ä¶ less sex with you. (Joey nods)

Ross: So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?

Chandler: Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.

Phoebe: (enthusiastic) That's great.

Chandler: Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating 

(At the same time, Gunther puts down a cup of coffee in front of Chandler)

Chandler: (grinning awkwardly) Humiliating and noble!

(Gunther shoots a nasty look at him while leaving)

Ross: You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.

Monica: Ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?""

Ross: Yes, I did, I did! (He turns to Joey, disappointed) I should have written it down!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Aparment, Monica sits at the table]

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Monica: Hey!

Joey: Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. (Monica smiles) ... and I smelled bacon. (taking some)

Monica: He just left.

Joey: (puzzled) Who did? (Monica looks bewildered)

Rachel: (entering) Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called. 

Joey: (standing up, surprised) She did?

Rachel: (enthusiastic) You got it!

Joey: (still surprised) I did?

Monica: What is she talking about?

Joey: I don't know, but it sounds great. 

Rachel: Your agent called. You got that audition.

Joey: With Lennart Haze?

Rachel: Yes.

Joey: Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway‚Ä¶ and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.

Monica: Is it a good play?

Joey: Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word. 

Rachel: Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it‚Ä¶

Joey: Yeah, yeah, and directing.

Monica: (sighs) He was so good in that movie of MacBeth. 

Rachel: (disbelieving) You saw that?

Monica: No, but‚Ä¶ I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.

Rachel and Joey: (pointing at Monica, a look of recognition in their faces) Ah!

Joey: Yeah, he's done some amazing works.

Rachel: Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials. 

Joey: (almost laughing) I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. (They all laugh)

Monica: Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!

Joey: (sitting down) Don't make me more nervous than I already am!


[Scene: Chandler's new workplace, his fellow interns are already seated around a table]

Chandler: (entering) Good morning, everybody.

Intern: Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?

Chandler: Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys‚Ä¶ except for the tie, the briefcase‚Ä¶ and the fact that I can rent a car.

Intern: Seriously, you're an intern?

Chandler: Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.

Intern: (shaking his head disbelievingly) Dude!

Chandler: Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope (he sits down) 

(Everybody gives him an inquiring look)

Chandler: The comedian? USO?!

Intern: (correcting him) Uhm, it's USA, sir.

(Chandler desperately covers his head in his hands)


[Scene: Audition room, Joey is lead into the room by a receptionist in a fancy dress]

Receptionist: This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze. 

(Lennart Haze turns around in his chair to face Joey) 

Joey: It is so amazing to meet you. (They are shaking hands) I'm such a big fan of your work.

Lennart: Well, I've‚Ä¶ I've been blessed with a‚Ä¶ a lot of great roles. 

Joey: Tell me about it! ""Unlimited nights and weekends!"" 

Lennart: You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. (He stands up and walks menacingly towards Joey) I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.

Joey: No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials. 

Lennart: Really?

Joey: Yeah.

Lennart: Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.

Joey: (regaining confidence) Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon‚Ä¶

Lennart: Peeeeeooooooooch (He mimes flying out of the cannon) ""Hang up that phone!"" One take!

Joey: Wow!

Lennart: So, shall we read?

Joey: Oh, yah, sure.

Lennart: Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it? 

(Joey nods whereupon Lennart acts as if he is entering a room)

Lennart: ""What the hell are you still doing here""?

(Joey stares at him, fascinated by his performance)

Joey: Err, ""I think you know"". 

Lennart: ""Bastard""!

Joey: ""I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now.""

Lennart: ""Go, go!""

Joey: ""I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't.""

Lennart: I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say ""long pause""

Joey: (understandingly) Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a‚Ä¶ (He mimes wearing a feather on his head)

Lennart: No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you. 

Joey: Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern (He speaks in what he believes is a Southern accent) ""I could go right now, maaan!""

Lennart: (stunned, muttering) My god in heaven. 

(The producers stand up)

Producer #1: Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?

(They stand aside, talking)

Lennart: You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. (Joey hears that and his disappointment is reflected in his facial expression). 

(Producer #1 whispers something)

Lennart: Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time. (Joey smiles smugly at this) This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door.

(Joey approaches them)

Joey: (interrupting their conversation) Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: (to Producer #1) 'How you doing?' (to Lennart again) You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please. 

Lennart: Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?

Joey: Yeah.

Lennart: Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much. 

Joey: I really doubt that. 

Lennart: (explaining to Joey, who nods fervently) No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you. 

(Joey ponders on this for a while)

Joey: (suggesting) Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?


[Scene: Backstreet, Ross and Phoebe walking]

Phoebe: Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?

Ross: Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her. 

Phoebe: Oh, I hear divorce bells. 

(A mugger, his face hidden by a cap, approaches them from behind)

Mugger: Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem. 

Ross: (taken aback) What?

Mugger: I have a gun (It looks like he has a gun under his coat)

Ross: O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. (He searches his coat and freaks out). Oh my god, I can't find my wallet. 

(He finally finds the wallet and hands it to the mugger)

Mugger: Alright, lady, now give me your purse!

Phoebe: No.

Ross: (still in a high-pitched voice) What do you mean ""no""? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay. 

(A sign of recognition runs across Phoebe's face)

Phoebe: Lowell, is that you?

Lowell: Phoebe? (He lifts his cap) Oh my god!

Phoebe: (simultaneously) Oh my god! 

(They hug and scream)

Phoebe: (excited) I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.

Lowell: Ross, nice to meet you. (He stretches his hand out to him) 

Ross: Yeah, a real pleasure.

Phoebe: Ah, it's been so long, so long. (They hug again) I can't believe you're still doing this!

Lowell: Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!

Phoebe: Good for you! 

Lowell: So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?

Phoebe: Ouh‚Ä¶ (she nods)

Ross: (shocked) Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people? 

Phoebe: Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up‚Ä¶


[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica sits on the couch as Joey enters]

Monica: Hey, how did the audition go? 

Joey: Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me. (He sits down) 

Monica: What happened?

Joey: Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.

Monica: So far so good! (Joey nods)

Chandler: (entering, carrying a large box) Honey, I'm old!

Monica: (standing up, walking towards him) What's wrong?

Chandler: I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.

Monica: So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.

Chandler: Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. (He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)

Joey: Wooooooooow (He takes the sneaker) It's like they're on fire!

Monica: What are they? (They sit down again)

Chandler: They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.

Joey: (determined) I give you $ 500 for them!

Chandler: What am I supposed to do with these?

Monica: Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.

Chandler: Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps"". (He takes a sneaker) And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! (to Monica) Would you help me try to sell these?

Monica: Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? 

Chandler: No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. 

Joey: Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords? 


[Scene: Central Perk, Monica sits on the couch as Phoebe and Ross enter]

All: Hey, hey!

Ross: Hey, you'll never guess what just happened‚Ä¶ Phoebe and I got mugged!

Monica: You okay?!

Ross: (sitting down) Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger! 

Monica: (bewildered) How do you know a mugger?

Phoebe: I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. 

Ross: You wanna know how she knew him? (He points at Phoebe) Because Phoebe used to mug people. 

Monica: (shocked) Seriously?

Phoebe: Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know‚Ä¶ sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I‚Ä¶

Monica: (disapproving) Phoebe, that is awful!

Phoebe: Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony‚Ä¶ I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer‚Ä¶

Monica: You're mother killed herself!

Phoebe: She was a drug dealer!

Ross: Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because (menacingly) I was about to do some serious damage! 

Phoebe: (laughing) Okay‚Ä¶

Monica: Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.

Phoebe: Why?

Monica: Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.

Phoebe: (worried) You were?

Ross: Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics‚Ä¶ you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week- 

Monica: (coughing) Wonderwoman!

Ross: Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone‚Ä¶ (He looks at Monica) ‚Ä¶ when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: ""Gimme your money, punk!""

Phoebe: (shocked) Oh my god‚Ä¶

Ross: I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: ""Science Boy""

Monica: Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?

Ross: A superhuman thirst for knowledge.

Monica: That's it. 

Ross: Well, I-I better get to class (He stands up) Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?

Phoebe: No‚Ä¶ actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street‚Ä¶ that's where stabby Joe works. 

(Ross leaves Central Perk)

Phoebe: Okay, I think we have a problem here. 

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics. 

Monica: Yeah?

Phoebe: Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. 

Monica: So?

Phoebe: Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-

Phoebe and Monica: ""Geology rocks!"" 

Monica: Oh my god!

Phoebe: I know‚Ä¶ I mugged Ross! 


[Scene: Audition room, the producers and Lennart are waiting for Joey]

Receptionist: You're late!

Joey: (entering) I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?

Receptionist: No, Lennart doesn't wait!

Joey: But I'm bursting with u-hu!

Lennart: (spotting Joey) Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!

Joey: Actually, I really need‚Ä¶

Lennart: (interrupting) We must go now, quickly, please.

Joey: Yes‚Ä¶ ahahaaa (He seems to be in pain)

Lennart: Ready? ""What the hell are you still doing here?""

Joey: (walking on the spot) ""I think you know!"" 

Lennart: ""Oh, you sick bastard!""

Joey: ""I am what you made me! You know what?""

Lennart: ""What?""

Joey: ""I could go right now."" 

Lennart: ""Then go, go!""

Joey: (urgent) ""I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!""

Lennart: Cut! That was good. (He turns to the producers) That was very good. You did everything I asked for. 

Joey: (disbelieving) I did? 

Lennart: Yes. Plus‚Ä¶ what you've got that‚Ä¶ I don't know what you've got going‚Ä¶ this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but ‚Äì you know what? ‚Äì more, more. Can you do that?

Joey: Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go. (He grabs his jacket and limps out of the room)

Lennart: (watching Joey leave) Look at that: still in character, I like it‚Ä¶ I plant seeds I can't explain.


[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Chander sits on the couch as Monica and Rachel enter]

Monica: Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

Monica: What are you doing?

Chandler: Putting on the sneakers‚Ä¶ thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything‚Ä¶

Rachel: Oh, anything yet?

Chandler: Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!

(At that moment, Joey opens the door)

Joey: (entering) Hey!

All: Hey! 

(Joey heads straight for the fridge, takes all the beverage cans and is about to leave the apartment)

Joey: Probably wanna know what I'm doing‚Ä¶?

Monica: No, that seems about right.

Joey: Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!

Rachel: Joey, that was formula.

Joey: We gotta get more of that. (He leaves the apartment)

Chandler: (sitting on the couch) You know what‚Ä¶ these aren't half-bad! (to Rachel) You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.

Rachel: Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph. 

Chandler: Alright (He stands wearing the sneakers on) I feel youger already! 

(He trips and falls hard on his back)

Chandler: (on the floor) Yah, I think I broke my hip.


[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there drinking coffee and Ross is about to enter]

Phoebe: (spotting Ross) Hey, you!

Ross: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey, how was class?

Ross: No one ever asked me that, what's wrong? 

Phoebe: Nothing, I really wanna know.

Ross: Oh‚Ä¶ (He looks positively surprised) Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene‚Ä¶

Phoebe: (interrupting) Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make‚Ä¶ uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid‚Ä¶

Ross: (disbelieving) Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.

Phoebe: You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.

Ross: No, it wasn't.

Phoebe: Yes, it was. 

Ross: No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old‚Ä¶

Phoebe: (interrupting, pinching his year) ""Gimme your money, punk!""

Ross: (shocked) Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you‚Ä¶ you mugged me? 

Phoebe: (apologetic) Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. (She smiles at him, but he doesn't understand) I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have‚Ä¶ have a great one! 

Ross: It's not the best!

Phoebe: I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say‚Ä¶

Ross: (indignant) There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. 

Phoebe: Really? Even more humiliating than‚Ä¶

Ross: (interrupting) Hey, let's not do this! 

(He picks up his briefcase and walks out of the door, leaving Phoebe behind)


[Scene: Chandler's new workplace, we are witnessing a presentation of a fellow intern]

Intern: ‚Ä¶ and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!

Boss: (ironic) That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? (Chandler raises his hand) Chander‚Ä¶

Chandler: Okay‚Ä¶ (He stands up) You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age‚Ä¶

Intern: (snorting) Your age?

Chandler: A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know‚Ä¶ maybe he falls‚Ä¶ maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: ""Not suitable for adults!"" 

Boss: Chandler, that's great! 

Chandler: Oh, thank you, sir‚Ä¶ or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me (He sits down again)

Boss: You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's‚Ä¶. (enthusiastic) You did you come up with that?

Chandler: (over-enthusiastic) I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.

Boss: That is great. Good work!

Chandler. Thank you. 

Boss: See all of you tomorrow. (He leaves)

(Chandler stands up and walks out the room with a cane)

Chandler: The cold weather hurts my hip!


[Scene: Central Perk, Ross sits in a chair as Phoebe enters]

Phoebe: Hey, Ross! (He lowers his newspaper and scowls at her) I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? 

Ross: Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. (He raises his hands as if being mugged)

Phoebe: I just really wanted to apologize again and‚Ä¶ and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. 

(She puts a box on her lap, labelled ""crap from the street"") 

Ross: (faking enthusiasm) Oh my god, crap from the street? (She smiles excitedly, but Ross just turns back to his newspaper) 

Phoebe: Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell‚Ä¶ or smoke. (Ross looks at her in astonishment) Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy"" (She holds up some sheets of paper and hands them to Ross)

Ross: Oh my god. (He sighs) I never thought I'd see this again. (He browses trough the pages) It's all here. What made you save it all these years? 

Phoebe: I can't say, I just thought it was really good‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ maybe would be worth something some day. 

Ross: You really thought ""Science Boy"" was worth saving! 

Phoebe: Yeah‚Ä¶ but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. 

Ross: Still‚Ä¶ this is amazing‚Ä¶ Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe. 

Phoebe: You're welcome. And thank you for ""Science Boy"". I learned a lot from him 

Ross: You're welcome. 


[Scene: Audition room, Joey and Lennart are rehearsing]

Joey: (hoping frantically on the spot, screaming) ""I need an answer!""

Lennart: ""I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know.""

Joey: ""You know!""

Lennart: ""I don't know!""

Joey: ""I need an answer now!"" 

Lennart: ""Alright, here, you want an answer‚Ä¶ the answer‚Ä¶ is‚Ä¶""

(He pauses while Joey struggles to avoid wetting his pants) 

Joey: (screaming) Oh!

Lennart: ""She never loved me, she only loved you.""

Joey: ""You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for ‚Äì Bang ‚Äì End Scene!""

Lennart: Absolutely amazing! (The producers applaud Joey) The part is yours. 

Joey: (in pain) Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get‚Ä¶

Lennart: Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! (He hugs Joey) You can relax now. Yeah.

(Joey relaxes and wets his pants while hugging Lennart)

Closing Credits

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica sits at the table reading the mail]

Monica: Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn‚Ä¶ on a Saturday afternoon?! (shocked) I was in the house! 

Ross: (entering) Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that‚Ä¶

Monica: ‚Ä¶ that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah. 

Ross: I see. You didn't happen to tell‚Ä¶

Monica: ‚Ä¶ everybody we know? Yeah.

Ross: Great. Thanks! (He leaves)

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler and Monica are looking through
  some papers.]
Chandler: Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Monica: I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since
  I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all
  our money?
Chandler: I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Monica: I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than
  we're bringing in.
Chandler: Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Monica: Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask
  you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know...
  finding gold.
Chandler: You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal
  out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next
  month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's
  refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing
  soda and beer?
Monica: Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Chandler: No! We're not borrowing money.
Monica: Why not?
Chandler: Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing
  my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool
  house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Monica: Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
Chandler: That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through
  this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Mike and Phoebe seem to have finished watching
  a movie on television.]
Mike: I'm gonna go. (He kisses Phoebe on the cheek)
Phoebe: Why??
Mike: I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more
  clothes.
Phoebe: Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
Mike: I put that tube top on as a joke.
Phoebe: I want you to stay.
Mike: I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers
  as I can..
Phoebe: Why don't you turn them inside ou...
Mike: Done it. (Phoebe becomes a little more subdued) I'll be back in a couple
  of hours.
Phoebe: I'll miss you.
Mike: Me too. (He leaves. A few moments later, he enters again.) You know
  what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.
Phoebe: Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Mike: No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and
  partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm
  there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?
Phoebe: Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell
  yeah!""
Mike: So we're doing it?
Phoebe: Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! (They embrace and Mike kisses
  Phoebe) Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
Mike: Yeah!
Phoebe: I've always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put
  down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We're not having sex anymore!"" It's
  gonna be fun!
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Monica enters.]
Monica: Hey Joey!
Joey: Hey!
Monica: Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never
  get back to Chandler.
(Joey frowns...then looks as if he understands)
Joey: I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is
  my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.
Monica: (Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's
  not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
Joey: Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always
  a mistake.
Monica: But Chandler lent you money!
Joey: And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Monica: Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
Joey: Oh...how much?
Monica: Two thousand dollars?
Joey: Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Monica: Yeah...
Joey: That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel enters)
Rachel: Hi you guys!
Joey & Monica: Hey!
Joey: Oo...what's in the bag?
Rachel: Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this
  place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff
  to baby-proof the apartment.
Joey: Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when
  I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or
  er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!
Monica: Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Rachel: No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
Joey: You're gonna do it?
Rachel: Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Joey: Oh, women can. You can't.
Rachel: Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Monica: You're a pig. And you can't do this.
Rachel: Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
Joey: The hardware store is right down the street.
Rachel: There is a hardware store right down the street?
[Scene: Central Perk. Ross, Chandler and Monica are sitting on the couch.
  Phoebe and Mike enters.]
Phoebe: Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
Mike: Phoebe and I are moving in together.
Monica, Chandler, Ross: Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Phoebe: I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
Monica: Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal
  your makeup. Unless they're playing ""This is what my sister would look
  like"" (Looks at Chandler)
Chandler: Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Mike: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Phoebe: Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
Mike: Yes dear.
Monica: Is that a bit you guys do?
Phoebe: Uh huh...we're playing you two.
Monica: We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Chandler: Yes dear.
Ross: I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great!
  I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
Monica: I hear wedding bells.
Phoebe: Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You
  know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah.
  Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that
  highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house
  in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send
  Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
Ross: Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Phoebe: I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a
  soccer mom!
Mike: You ready to go?
Phoebe: Yeah! You bet roomy!
Monica: Don't you mean..groomy?
Mike: What are you talking about?
Phoebe: Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have
  us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously.
  They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)
Phoebe: China patterns!!!!!
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Rachel is fiddling with the drawer.]
Rachel: This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater
  sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. (Fiddles more)
[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler sits on the couch. Joey sits at the round table]
Chandler: Hey Joe!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything
  about it.
Joey: I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Chandler: And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica
  and I are having a little financial trouble.
Joey: Yeah, I know.
Chandler: What? What do you mean you know?
Joey: Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and
  the economy is bad.
Chandler: Oh! Right.
Joey: (to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Chandler: Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
Joey: Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Chandler: Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins
  writing a cheque)
Joey: Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your
  rent is. (shrugs)
Chandler: Oh ok.
Joey: (To himself) I am on fire!
Chandler (Stands up and walks to Joey): Listen...this is really nice. Do you...
  (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars?
  Did Monica borrow money from you?
Joey: Err... Kind of.
Chandler: I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Joey: Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems,
  it was for something for her.
Chandler: What?
Joey: Something personal.
Chandler: What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she
  wouldn't tell me about?
(Woman with huge breasts cuts across them. Takes Joey's coffee)
Woman: Excuse me.
Joey: Boob job.
Monica: I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Joey: Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would
  be crazy.
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe and Mike are packing stuff.]
Mike: Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little ""groomy"" joke.
Phoebe: Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's
  a play on the word roomy.
Mike: I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is...
  maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not
  expecting a proposal, right?
Phoebe: Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where
  it goes.
Mike: Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.
Phoebe: What do you mean?
Mike: Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married
  again.
Phoebe: Oh. Wow.
Mike: It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of
  lost faith in the whole idea.
Phoebe: Was it really that bad?
Mike: At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....
Phoebe: Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with
  someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in
  the ocean.
Mike: Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time
  I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!
Phoebe: But it's just...
Mike: Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.
Phoebe: Oh!
Mike: I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together
  isn't the best idea.
Phoebe: No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make
  sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start
  changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
Mike: Trust me, I will never...
Phoebe: Yeah I get that.
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Rachel is flipping through magazines. Handyman is
  installing things. Monica enters.]
Rachel: Hi!
Monica: So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Rachel: Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
Handyman: You're all set. (picks up his bag and starts to leave)
Rachel: Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh wait!
  You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)
Handyman: Thanks.....
(Chandler enters)
Chandler: Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Rachel: Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
Monica: Thank you?
Chandler: Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing
  I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...
  single things.
Monica: Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Chandler: No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Monica: Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still
  ok.
Chandler: Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.
  I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more
  specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
Monica: Okay...
Chandler: I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would
  you? Don't answer that.
(He leaves)
Rachel: Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Monica: I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
Rachel: I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
Monica: Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting
  to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Rachel: No you really think that's what it is?
Monica: You heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""You're perfect!"" ""Just
  don't get any bigger!"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling
  coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
Rachel: Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your
  breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose
  bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!
[Scene:Ross's apartment. Phoebe is at the door.]
Phoebe: Hi
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
Ross: Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for
  all hanging out but to come to my home!
Phoebe: No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Ross: Why?
Phoebe: Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Ross: Never?
Phoebe: Never.
Ross: wow, are you still going to move in with him?
Phoebe: I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really
  that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything.
  That marriage stinks!
Ross: Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight
  and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
Phoebe: That's not how you really feel is it?
Ross: No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now
  but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Phoebe: Seriously? You divorce-o?
Ross: If you have to call me name, I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer"".
  It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love
  to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before
  she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
Phoebe: It's ok that's how you feel.
Ross: But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have
  so much fun and you love Mike.
Phoebe: I do love Mike.
Ross: Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and
  you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
Phoebe: Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
Ross: The Divorcer, to the rescue!
Phoebe: It's not cooler.
Ross: Yeah I just hurt it.
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey enters carrying a tub of ice cream. He sets
  it on the table, takes off his jacket and struggles with the drawer. It cannot
  be opened.]
Joey: Rach?! (He walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened
  either) Rachel!!!!? (He walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet
  seat cover. It won't come up.) So I can't do anything I like????
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler enters. Rachel and monica
  are seated at the table.]
Chandler: Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change
  a thing. Not a thing.
Monica: Honey?
Chandler: Yeah?
Monica: About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Chandler: But honey you don't have to.
Monica: I'm going to get bigger!
Chandler: Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Rachel: Argh. fascist
Monica: Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not!
  And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger
  too.
Chandler: your ass?!?!?
Rachel: Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
Chandler: They...do that?
Monica: It's kind of a package deal!
Chandler: God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Monica: I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Chandler: Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get
  on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Rachel: Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to
  be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present
  that's shooting out of her!?
Chandler: (sedated) What?
[Scene: Joey's apartment. He's prying open the drawer with a crowbar to no
  avail. Monica, Rachel and Chandler enter.]
Rachel: Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Joey: Because she is!
Monica: Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
Joey: Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
Monica, Rachel, Chandler: It's over/Joe!
Joey: OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any
  bigger?
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Ross is helping with the packing, Phoebe and Mike
  are also there.]
Ross: Hey! What do you guys think about this. ""Ross: The Divorce-Force"".
Phoebe: Better.
Mike: Very cool.
Ross: Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the
  other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
Phoebe: Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
Ross: Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised
  I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
Phoebe: What do you mean?
Ross: Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in
  the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly
  picture yourself in a Volvo?
Phoebe: They are awfully boxy...
Ross: I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Phoebe: Uh huh.
(Chandler, Monica, Joey and Rachel are carrying a couch through the door)
Ross: Hey hey, can I help?
Chandler: Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow
  hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets
  really tricky.
Ross: You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Joey: Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
Rachel: Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I
  mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
Phoebe: Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle
  room? None at all?
Mike: No but... You don't want to get married either right?
Phoebe: Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Joey: (voice strained) Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Mike: You wanna get married?
Phoebe: Someday.
Chandler: Aaaaand....... hernia.
Phoebe: I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was
  missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the
  regular stuff.
Mike: But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
Phoebe: Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and
  I wanted to live with you.
Mike: I want to live with you too! Let's do that!
Phoebe: But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what
  was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
Mike: Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind
  about marriage.
Phoebe: Are you gonna change yours?
Mike: No.
Phoebe: Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
Mike: But I don't want this to end.
Phoebe: I don't want it to end either.
Mike: I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed
  up.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Mike: Ok... so...(They hug) Goodbye.
Chandler/Joey/Rachel/Monica: Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Rachel: I'm so sorry Pheebs.
Monica: We're all sorry... (They have a group hug)
Chandler: Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with
  this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)

[Scene: Ross' apartment , Chandler and Joey enter]
Chandler: Hey! Ready to go?
Ross: Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Joey: Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!
Chandler: What are you doin'?
Ross: Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
Chandler: Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
Ross: It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Chandler: The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Ross: Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... 
Chandler: Bet she'd sleep with you now... 
Ross: No... I already e-mailed her.
Chandler: Let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "" (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
Ross: You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Joey: Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
Ross: (he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
Chandler: Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had""... aaand SEND!
Joey: (he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
Ross: (he comes back) Alright, let's go!
Joey: Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)
Ross: I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
Joey: (after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)
Opening credits
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment]
Rachel: Hey! How was basketball?
Joey: Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Rachel: Oh, no! Who did that?
Joey: Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)
Rachel: She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
Joey: (still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Rachel: Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
Joey: Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount... 
Rachel: All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
Joey: Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
[Scene: Central Perk]
Phoebe: Hi.
Monica: Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Phoebe: Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
Chandler: Oh, I'm so sorry!
Phoebe: Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this... 
Chandler: You're not gonna need my help?
Phoebe: Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
Chandler: Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)
Phoebe: Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
Monica: Ok, you got it!
Phoebe: (after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
Monica: Really? If that's what you want... 
Phoebe: That was a test and you just failed.
Monica: Damn it! Rookie mistake!
(Ross enters and he's really angry. He goes towards Chandler who's sitting at the counter)
Ross: (yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??
Chandler: I believe I read that somewhere!
Ross: That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  (pause) It's not funny!!
Chandler: I respectfully disagree.
Ross: I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Chandler: Who cares? Nobody reads those things
Ross: You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Chandler: I don't have a page.
Ross: Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
[Scene: Rachel's room. Rachel and Emma are sleeping; Joey sneaks in and approaches the crib]
Joey: Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)
Rachel: (threatening Joey with a scrunchy): Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
Joey: It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
Rachel: What are you doing?
Joey: Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Rachel: Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Joey: (placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie...  (to Emma) This isn't over.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is looking at the screen of his laptop, shaking his head.]
Monica: Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  (reads from the screen) ""gay as the day is long""?
Chandler: Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Monica: But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)
Chandler: Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Monica: (On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Chandler: Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).
Monica: What are you doing?
Chandler: Oh, you'll see my friend.
[Time lapse, still Chandler and Monica's, but only Chandler is there. Enter Ross]
Ross: (visibly upset) I'm dead?
Chandler: (faking sympathy) And so young.
Ross: Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Chandler: Well, how you died was funny.
Ross: Oh please, hit by a blimp?
Chandler: It kills over one americans every year.
Ross: Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
Chandler: You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Ross: You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment]
Phoebe: God, I wish Mike were here.
Monica: Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
(Phoebe gives her a meaningful look)
Monica: What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Phoebe: I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
Monica: Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.
Phoebe: Here.
Monica: And now your cell.
Phoebe: Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)
Monica: This is your cellphone?
Phoebe: Yes.
Monica: This is your current cellphone?
Phoebe: Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
Monica: Phoebe, where's your purse?
(They run for Phoebe's purse, Phoebe gets there first and takes the cell. Monica tries to take it away from her)
Monica: No, no! Give it to me!
Phoebe: You can't have it.
Monica: Give it to me!
Phoebe: No (tucks it in her pants)
Monica: I'll go in there.
Phoebe: (disbelievingly) Oh yeah.
Monica: Phoebe come here
(they fight a little, the phone falls and Monica picks it up)
Monica: Haha!
Phoebe: Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's. Enter Joey]
Joey: Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
Rachel: Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
Joey: No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!
Rachel: Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Joey: No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
Rachel: Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail... 
Joey: Make the transfer! (She does so)
Rachel: Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Joey: Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
(Emma cries)
Rachel: Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Joey: But he's the same.
Rachel: Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
Joey: But he's the same.
Rachel: Joey, come on!
Joey: He's the same!
(they exchange Hugsy's).
Joey: (to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Enter Monica]
Monica: Haha!
Phoebe: You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Monica: So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
Phoebe: Those are my shoes.
Monica: Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
Phoebe: Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
(Someone knocks on the door)
Monica: Who's that? (goes to open door)
Phoebe: I ordered Chinese food.
(Monica opens the door and Mike is standing at the doorway)
Phoebe: What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Monica: (To Mike) What are you doing here?
Mike: Phoebe called me.
Monica: Phoebe!
Phoebe: I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him.
Monica: Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Phoebe: There is a speakerphone on the base unit... 
Monica: Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Mike: Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see... 
Monica: (to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!
Mike: Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
Monica: Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
Phoebe: Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Monica: Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).
Phoebe: Sit down.
(Phoebe and Mike sit next to each other)
Monica: Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
Mike: (to Phoebe) So how've you been?
Monica: I've been pretty good!
Mike: (to Phoebe) You look really beautiful.
Phoebe: Thanks, you look good too.
Monica: Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Phoebe: So how's the piano playing going?
Mike: Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
Phoebe: I've missed you too.
(Silence)
Monica: You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
[Scene: Ross's Apartment: Ross is doing something on his laptop when Chandler walks in]
Chandler: Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (¬≠looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
Ross: uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)
Chandler: Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Ross: Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
Chandler: No, come on, you know that's not true.
Ross: What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Chandler: Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
Ross: I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
Chandler: Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
Ross: You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Chandler: Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
Ross: Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
Chandler: Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Ross: No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Chandler: Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
Ross: oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... 
[Scene: Joey's room: Joey is sitting on his bed reading DooL transcript when Rachel walks in]
Rachel: I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
Joey: Original or crappy?
Rachel: Original.
Joey: No, sorry haven't seen him.
Rachel: Then what's that big lump under your covers?
Joey: It's Monica, ok?
Rachel: That's not Monica!
Joey: Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
Rachel: (to herself) Oh God.
Joey: ... she's being unreasonable!
Rachel: (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
Joey: It does?
Rachel: Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
Joey: Really? She... she loves me?
Rachel: Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).
Joey: Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him.
Rachel: Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!
Joey: Look forget it forget it...  I can't do it.
Rachel: Are you gonna...  you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
Joey: How do you think I got him in the first place?
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment: Phoebe, Monica and Mike sitting on the couch]
(Monica is getting up from the couch)
Monica: Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
Mike: I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
Phoebe: I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
Mike: It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time...  I never would have stopped.
Monica: (running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!
Phoebe: What?
Monica: Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
Phoebe: Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)
Strange man: (he bounds into the house) I knew you'd be here!
Mike: Oh, crap!
Phoebe: Who is this?
Mike: My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
Monica: Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
Manny: Well, you are not doing a very good job!
Monica: Excuse me?
Manny: What's with the kissing?
Monica: Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
Manny: Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
Monica: You didn't hear the speech!
Manny: I've heard the speech: (in a mocking voice) ""if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... ""
Monica: Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
Manny: You're weak!
Monica: You're... weird!
Manny: Your pants are undone!
Monica: Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
Manny: (looking at the sofa) Where did they go?
Monica: Damn it!
Manny: Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
Monica: And I blame you too.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]
Ross: It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
(someone knocks on the door)
Chandler: There you go! Someone came!
Ross: Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)
(Chandler and Monica go open the door)
Monica: Hi, glad you could come.
Chandler: (in a mournful voice) Please, come in.
Tom: Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
Chandler: Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
Tom: Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's... 
Chandler: At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
Ross: Who is he?
Chandler: Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Ross: I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)
Monica: So, did you know Ross well?
Tom: Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?
Monica: (a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.
Tom: What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
Chandler: (entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)
Tom: (before leaving) Hey, listen. Call me.
Chandler: Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)
Ross: (coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?
Monica: I look like a man??
Chandler: Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
Ross: It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
Chandler: You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
Ross: Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Chandler: Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Ross: (sceptical) Yeah... 
(someone knocks on the door) Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!
Chandler: I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)
(Chandlers opens the door. A beautiful woman stands at the doorway.)
Kori: Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Chandler: Kori? Kori Weston?
Kori: Yeah... 
Chandler: Wow! You look amazing!
Kori: And you are... 
Chandler: Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
Monica: You are married though.
Chandler: Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)
Kori: I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
Chandler: I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Kori: We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
Chandler: I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
Kori: I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
Ross: (he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
Kori: You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! (she leaves and slams the door behind her)
Ross: Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
Ending Credits
[Scene: Ross' apartment]
Ross: (on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?

[Scene: Central Perk - Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Ross
and Rachel are sitting on the sofas. Joey enters]
Joey: Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
Monica: Ok.
Joey: Alright!
Monica: But ehm...what is it not?
Joey: (abashed) A place to entertain my lady friends.
Monica: And what else is it not?
Joey: (even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti.
Monica: Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need it
for anyway?
Joey: Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and
they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...
Rachel: Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Joey: (hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not West
Virginia.
Monica: Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy
some tickets myself! 
Joey: Uh!
Monica: Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really
use 300 million dollars.
Chandler: Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300
million? No thank you!
Phoebe: Hey will you get me tickets too?
Rachel: Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all
pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win,
we'll split it!
Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a great
idea!
Ross: No thanks!
Phoebe: You don't wanna win the lottery?
Ross: (in a  mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna
be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Chandler: Still on Amelia Earhart?
Ross: The woman just vanished!
Joey: Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
Ross: No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the
lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by
lightning 42 times.
Chandler: Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get
struck by lightning 7 times.
Joey: I like those odds!
Ross: Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to
spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Chandler: (looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross)
Boohaki?
Ross: Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're
trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Rachel: Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki,
goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
Monica: How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Rachel: Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she
understands what I'm saying.
Chandler: Kinda like Joey.
Joey: (who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?
Opening credits
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica,
Chandler, Rachel and Joey are in the kitchen]
Monica: God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You
know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
Chandler: Pie eating contest?
Monica: Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way
I could win something? 
Chandler: No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Monica: (smiling)That was a good day!
(Suddenly Ross comes running into the apartment)
Ross: (yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they're
towing your car!!
Monica: I'm parked in a garage on Morton! 
Ross: (panting)They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
Joey: (sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma!
And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who has
Emma!?
Rachel: Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You
were there!
Joey: (not yelling anymore)I was?
Racel: Yes and you talked to her...
Joey: I did?
Rachel: She dropped off a casserole?
Joey: Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
Monica: (to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the big
bucks?
Ross: Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could
all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing
on top of it!
(phone starts ringing and Chandler comes running out of the bathroom)
Chandler: (hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll
get it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)
Ross: (to Monica)Think he washed his hands?
Chandler: (into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
Rachel: (to Monica)What's going on?
Monica: Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an
assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are
only hiring three.
Joey: Ooh! Tough odds!
Ross: (mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your
24 state lottery!
Joey: (smiling)Look who's coming around!
Chandler: (still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me when
you know more.
Joey: (excited)Did you get it?
Chandler: One of the slots got filled.
Joey: (Still excited)By you!?
Chandler: Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Monica: Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your
pants!
Chandler: Yeah I know.
Rachel: Well, there's two spots left right?
Chandler: Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna
get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care
about Charlie.
(Phoebe enters)
Phoebe: (excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to
believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna
win the lottery tonight!
Monica: Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra
luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
Ross: (mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone
else a chance!
Monica: Alright, who wants to do it?
Phoebe: Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.
It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the
meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
Monica: Ok, hey Rach?
Rachel: Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell
all over my hands.
Joey: I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
(Phoebe and Joey both grab one side of the wishbone)
Phoebe: I hope I win!
Monica: Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing
for the same thing, right?
Joey: I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you
know...won't come true!
Monica: Right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!
Joey: Can't really say!
Monica: I understand, but you're wishing for what we think
you're wishing for, aren't you?
Joey: (slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable with
these questions!
Rachel, Chandler and Monica: Please, just do it!
Phoebe: One, two, three!
(they break the wishbone)
Joey: I won, hey!
Ross: You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true,
but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub
this lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thing
gets hot!!
Rachel: You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are
you gonna feel if we actually do win?
Ross: Uh, you're not gonna win.
Rachel: Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but
somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel?
You know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our
helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, I can't
guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai""
Ross: Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like
that.
Chandler: I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners' friend
filled with regret eats own arm"".
Ross: Why would I eat my own arm?
Chandler: Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can
print whatever we want.
Monica: You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for
you.
Ross: Why?
Monica: Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki""
but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're
my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
Ross: You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just
the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet!
Come here (they kiss and hug)
Phoebe: Get a room!
Chandler: Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if
we win?
Ross: I don't know, probably just invest it.
Chandler: Ooh! Calm down ...
Joey: Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? 
Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, did I say ""invest it""? I meant ""be cool
and piss it all away"" (Joey and Chandler pleased)
Joey: Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy
the Knicks!
Rachel: I don't really care about the Knicks.
Joey: Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
Rachel: (touched) You would do that? I never get picked!
Chandler: You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to
go.
Joey: You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe
you're taking this away from me!
Chandler: You're right, it has been you dream for over 15
seconds.
Ross: (to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the
numbers, Mommy?
(pause)
Chandler: (looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh
... Mommy?
Ross: Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy""
when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
Rachel: I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her
first word.
Ross: Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call
me ""Daddy"" too.
Phoebe: Oooh, I like that, ""daddy"" (in a sexy tone)
Ross: I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Phoebe: (still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is
daddy gonna spank me?
Ross: (tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you
been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't.
(Phone rings, Chandler picks up)
Chandler: Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else
hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with
him!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)
Joey: Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
Chandler: Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
Monica: Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as
anybody else of getting that job!
Chandler: He's the boss's son.
Monica: Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)
Rachel: Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Monica: Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as
quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas
how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this: we
divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by
whoever finishes their pile first.
Rachel: Ooh, I have another idea!
Monica: I'm sorry, idea time is over.
Phoebe: Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
Monica: Yeah.
Chandler: What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Monica: There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Chandler: Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
(Rachel get suspicious)
Monica: Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
Chandler: Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
Monica: Chandler, sense the tone!!
(Rachel comes out of their bedroom waving tickets)
Rachel: Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
(everyone's shocked)
Monica: Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and
Chandler.
Phoebe: Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
Ross: I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this
together!
Monica: Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
Ross: 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Joey: I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut,
when did you even get those?
Monica: When you were reading the dirty magazines without
taking off the plastic!
Joey: (to Ross) I'll show you how.
Rachel: Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets
win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all
your friends?
Monica: Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not
gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and
I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
Rachel: Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was
wrong?
Chandler: (to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought
tickets just for us ...
Monica: Ahhh!  (shocked)
Chandler: Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it
doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have
principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from
Rachel)
Monica: There's the man I married!!
Rachel: All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's
the last you're gonna hear from us!
Monica: Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends!
Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just
like you!
Rachel: (surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I
want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!
Joey: Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from
Rachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Ross: Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And
if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
Phoebe: Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets
together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)
Monica: No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl)
and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
Joey: Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me!
This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)
Chandler: Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Rachel: Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them
up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so
she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)
Joey: (in pain) Oh!
Phoebe: (she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she
starts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!
Ross: (trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!
Phoebe: (keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she
stops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she
goes out to the balcony)
Rachel: Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Joey: No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get
jammed in the window)
Phoebe: If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it
at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and
makes as to drop the tickets on the street).
Everyone: NO!!
Phoebe: Don't come any closer!
Chandler: Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are
getting squished...
Phoebe: No, what's more important, your friends or money?
Everyone but Monica: Friends! 
Monica: Money! (they all look at her) Friends...
Phoebe: Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
Monica: They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in
my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)...
Ross: Monica!
Phoebe: Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was
no way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebe
who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I broke
your bowl.
Ross: Go, go, go!!
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.]
(All are returning from the street after picking up dropped lottery
tickets)
Phoebe: What a beautiful night to be running around the
street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
Monica: Phoebe, we lost half of them.
Phoebe: So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My
psychic said I  was gonna win, remember?
Ross: Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the
scary pigeon...
Phoebe: As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to
die. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
Chandler: (looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's two
messages. These could be from work!
Monica: Oh, play them!
Chandler: Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)
Message: (Phoebe's voice) ""Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from
the balcony calling to apologise"" (they all turns to look at Phoebe) ""I
sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's
hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo.""
(they all keep staring at Phoebe)
Phoebe: Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
Second message: ""Hey Chandler, it's Charlie""
Chandler: This is..shhh!
Second Message: ""Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot.
I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a
call if you want.""
Monica: Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
All: Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
Rachel: Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they
promoted Sandra over me at work.
Chandler: Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
Rachel: No, she was just much better at job than me!
Phoebe: Guys, the drawing is about to start!
Rachel: (To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum's
house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
Ross: Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
Monica: (she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strong
about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
Chandler: Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.
(pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130
chances to win, right?
Monica: (she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants)
131! (they kiss)
Ross: (on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And
remember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel)
Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to
Rachel)
Rachel: Hi mum, put her back on!
Joey: (sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on!
They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself
changing.
TV: ""Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53""
Chandler: I got that!
Ross: Oh, we have one too!!
Monica: We are on a roll, people!!
Ross: (calling Rachel) Come on!!
Rachel: (on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your new
lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me
say goodnight to my daughter?
TV: ""And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7""
Monica: Check your numbers! Make me rich!
Rachel: (she goes towards the others and she's very excited)
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to
Emma and she said her first words!!
All: Wow!
Joey: And what did she say?
Rachel: She said ""gleba""!! (she celebrates)
(they just look at her for a moment; then they go back to checking
the tickets)
Monica: Make me rich!!
Rachel: (to Ross) Isn't that amazing?
Ross: Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
Rachel: Why-why aren't you more excited?
Ross: Oh, Rach...oh...""gleba"" is not a word.
Rachel: Oh, but of course it is!
Ross: Okay, what does it mean?
Rachel: I don't know all the words.
Ross: I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's
first words (goes back to checking the tickets).
Ross: Yes you did, gleba is a word!
Ross: Ok, use it in a sentence.
Rachel: Ok... ""Emma just said gleba""!
Ross: It's not a word!
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goes
and picks up the dictionary).
Ross: Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she
said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up:
pbbqqt....
(Rachel glares at him)
Rachel: (searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba,
gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing
inner mass of a certain fungi.
(Rachel shows Ross the definition on the dictionary, giving him a
smug look; then she squints at the dictionary, as though unsure what to
make out of it)
Ross: She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head,
very moved)
Joey: (checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?
Chandler: No.
Phoebe: I'm still looking through mine...
Monica: Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!
(phone rings)
Monica: (answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Chandler: Ah, the ""I'm sorry I rejected you"" phone call. I'm
not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the
sofa) Hey, Steve.
Steve: Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three
positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you
wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
Chandler: Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant!
Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not
too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
Steve: Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.
We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
Chandler: Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Steve: Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of
sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.
Chandler: Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you
tomorrow (hangs up).
(he idly goes to the sofa, starts browsing a magazine. Everybody
stares at him)
Chandler: What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior
copywriter.
Everybody: (excited) Oh my God, congratulations!
Monica: Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
Chandler: Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Monica: You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa
and goes to the kitchen area)
Joey: (to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job. 
Chandler: Thanks, man.
Joey: And I like to think I had a little something to do with
it.
Chandler: Really? What?
Joey: Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we
would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
Chandler: (smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the
kitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart
right out.
Joey: Oh yeah.
Rachel: You know what? There is a little part of me that
really thought we were gonna win.
Ross: Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme
park.
Phoebe: You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
Monica and Ross: Seven.
Phoebe: We won.
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: We won!
Monica: Let me see!
(they all jump up excitedly and try to see the ticket)
Phoebe: Don't tear it.
Ross: Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
Phoebe: I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number,
we've won 3 dollars!
Chandler: Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or
go for the big payout.
Phoebe: (still very excited) I don't care, I've never won
anything before, I can't believe this!
Rachel: So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
Phoebe: It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
Monica: You know what? You can have mine.
Chandler: Me too.
Joey: Me too.
Rachel: Me too.
(they all look at Ross)
Ross: I guess if everybody else is...
Closing credits
[Scene: Central Perk. They're all sitting there as
usual, except Joey. Gunther is serving a nearby table.]
(Joey comes in from the back of the coffee house)
Joey: (sitting in a chair) Hey guys, so I just called the
Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
Phoebe: I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her
plate of cookies).
Gunther: Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy
in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside,
and won $10,000 (goes to the counter).
(They all glare evilly at Phoebe)
Phoebe: (hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the
""pigeon voice"" from before) Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It
was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stop
staring at her.
(Joey stares around dumbly looking for the ""talking pigeon"")

Ross: Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
Chandler: I don't have travel insurance.
Ross: Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
Monica: Why don't you take Ross?
Ross: Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...

[Scene: Days of Our Lives' Studios]
Rachel: Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
Joey: I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!

Joey/Drake: Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.
Actress/Olivia: Get out!
Joey/Drake: You don't love him!
Actress/Olivia: What do you know about love?
Joey/Drake: I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
Actress/Olivia: That kiss never happened.
Joey/Drake: Oh, what about this one.
(the actress slaps him)Rachel: (watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH!
Actress/Olivia: No, I told you...get out!
Joey/Drake: Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...
Chase Lassiter: (talking to Rachel) You look familiar, have we...
Rachel: SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Joey/Drake: Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
Actress/Olivia: I don't have a choice...
Joey/Drake: Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.

1st Customer: Everything was delicious!

2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Monica: Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...
3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint.
Monica: Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
Monica: What musician?
[Scene: Outside the restaurant]
Phoebe: (playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Ol√®!
Monica: What are you doing here!
Phoebe: Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
Monica: Great!
Phoebe: Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, ""You suck"" and ""shut up and go home"".
Monica: Listen Phoebe...
Phoebe: Yeah.
Monica: You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Phoebe: But what?
Monica: This is kind of a classy place.
Phoebe: (pause) Ok, say no more.
[Time lapse: Phoebe in front of restaurant again]
Phoebe: (with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh?
(Monica covers her face with her hands)[Scene: hall of the romantic inn in Vermont]
Chandler: Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
Receptionist: Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
Chandler: New York.
Ross: (in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!
Chandler: I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Ross: Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
Receptionist: I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
Chandler: Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
Ross: (high pitched voice) Check again please!
Receptionist: I'm sorry, it's not here.
Ross: Not there.
Chandler: Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Receptionist: I don't know what to say.
Ross: (mumbling) She doesn't know what to say!
Chandler: Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Receptionist: Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
Chandler: That's insane!
Ross: Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Chandler: Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.
Receptionist: Great.
Chandler: (aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Ross: Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
Chandler: Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
Ross: C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Chandler: Dude, you're shaking!
Ross: I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
[Scene: Joey's apartment]
Rachel: Hi!
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
Joey: Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
Rachel: God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Joey: Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
Rachel: Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Joey: Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Rachel: Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Joey: Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Rachel: Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
Joey/Drake: I can't believe you married him.
Rachel/actress: But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
Joey/Drake: So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
Rachel/actress: It's over! You have to accept that.
Joey/Drake: How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
Rachel: (pause) Kiss me.
Joey: What?
Rachel: Kiss me.
Joey: Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
Rachel: No, I'm saying...
Joey: but, but..
Rachel: just... don't talk... (she kisses him)
[Scene: Rachel's bedroom]
Rachel: (waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new!
[Scene: Hotel's room]
Ross: (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. 
(Chandler enters the room)Ross: What did you get?
Chandler: USA Today
Ross: Nice, put it with the others.
Chandler: And I also got... two more apples.
Ross: We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!  
Chandler: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Ross: Oh, that's not cool.
Chandlers: Dude, none of this is cool.
Ross: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through.
Chandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.
Ross: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Chandler: Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?
Ross: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Chandler: Yes, but the batteries...
(Ross claps his hands)Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!
Ross: Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Chandler: No!
Ross: At least tell me where you hid it.
[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa]
Rachel: Can I ask you a question?
Monica: Yeah.
Rachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Monica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Rachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
Monica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
Rachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
Monica: What do you think brought than on?
Rachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
Monica: A love scene? With who?
Rachel: Olivia.
Monica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.
Rachel: So do you think that my dream means anything?
Monica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Rachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Monica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. 
Rachel: You took the same class twice.
Monica: It was hard!
(Phoebe comes in)Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel and Monica: Hi.
Phoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
Monica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
Phoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
Monica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
Phoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).
(silence)Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
Phoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Rachel: Ok, we're still on that.
Monica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Phoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
Monica: Tiny portions?
Phoebe: Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it""!
Monica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
Phoebe: Well...it's not about quality.
Monica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
Phoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
Monica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
Phoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
Monica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
Phoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini?
[Scene: Hotel's reception]
Receptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.
Chandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
(the receptions is puzzled. She goes in the back.)Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
Ross: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
(they make as if to go, but Ross notices something)Ross: Oh my god.
Chandler: What?
Ross: There's something new in the bowl.
Chandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away.
Ross: No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
Chandler: There's a forest right outside.
Ross: It's not the same.
Chandler: Ok, go quick!
(Ross starts stuffing pinecones in the suitcase. As the receptionist walks in, Chandler makes a bird's verse and Ross stops)Ross: (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.
(he picks up the suitcase, which falls open, revealing all the stuff they have taken from the hotel. The receptionist just looks at them.)Ross: Oh, my maple candy!
[Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing]
Phoebe: (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
(Monica comes out)Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Phoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
Monica: Ok, you have to stop playing now.
Phoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
Monica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Phoebe: (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Monica: (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)
Phoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!
Monica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).
Phoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
Monica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
Phoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).
Monica: Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)
Phoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
Monica: I'm sorry...
Phoebe: I'm sorry too... (they hug)
Monica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner? 
Phoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... 
(Monica seems to take it amiss)Phoebe: (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in]
Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
Joey: (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!
Rachel: (looks puzzled) How...how...?
Joey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? 
Rachel: uh-huh
Joey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very! 
Rachel: (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...
Joey: What?
Rachel: What...how is it going with Drake?
Joey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
Rachel: What...that scene I saw was so good!
Joey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
Rachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
Joey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
Rachel: So?
Joey: So...I've never played that!
Rachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
Joey: Uh...well...just once...with you...
Rachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
Joey: (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??
Rachel: (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
Joey: (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
Rachel: (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
Joey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
(Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)Joey: (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)

[Scene: Monica's apartment]
Joey: (enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
Chandler: (browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
Joey: Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
Chandler: I could fall asleep at a play.
Phoebe: What is it?
Joey: It's a one-woman play called ""Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life"".
Monica: It sounds interesting!
Ross: Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)
Phoebe: I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
Joey: You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
Ross: What? How come that you don't have to go!
Joey: I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
Chandler: (browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
Rachel: (gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
Joey: (lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go.
Rachel: Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?
Monica: Yeah.
Rachel: Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
Monica: No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
Rachel: No reason.
Monica: No, no, Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah
Monica: Who do you wanna fool around with?
Rachel: (with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!
(Monica points at Joey, Rachel turns and sees him)Rachel: (giggling and whispering) Maybe.
Monica: (whispering) You can't!
Rachel: (whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with ""because"") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Monica: In the hall.
[Scene: In the hall]
Monica: You wanna fool around with Joey?
Rachel: Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
Monica: Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Rachel: Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Monica: Who, who are they?
Rachel: I know them from work.
Monica: Both of them?
Rachel: No, one of them...
Monica: Which one?
Rachel: I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Monica: Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
Rachel: All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (Joey enters his apartment)
Monica: What the hell are you cooking!
Opening credits[Scene: Central Perk, Ross enters]
Ross: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
Chandler: Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
Ross: (covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
Monica: What's so bad about that?
Ross: It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Monica: (fingering her elbow): Ross?
Ross: (looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede.
(a woman walks in)Charlie: (to Gunther) Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
Gunther: No.
Ross: Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
Charlie: Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
Ross: Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
Charlie: It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
Ross: Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
Monica: (to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?
Chandler: (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Charlie: And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
Ross: Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
Monica: (to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Ross: (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
Charlie: Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
Ross: I don't think so.
Charlie: I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
Ross: Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all"". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?
Charlie: You don't think we should wait for him?
Ross: You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
Professor Spafford: Professor Geller?
Ross: Oh, damn it!
[Scene: Joey's apartment]
(Rachel enters the room and checks the answering machine)Jane: (from the answering machine) Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.
Joey: (entering the room) Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Joey: What's happenin'?
Rachel: Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
Joey: Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)
Message: ""Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight"" (Joey's upset and stops it)
Joey: (yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!
Rachel: (angry) You are having a party tonight??
Joey: Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
Rachel: And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
Joey: I do it every year.
Rachel: You do that every year??
Joey: I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Rachel: Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
Joey: Yeah...
Rachel: And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Joey: Yeah...
Rachel: OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
Joey: (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!
Rachel: Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
Joey: You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
Rachel: Well, then so you just invite me...!
Joey: (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
Rachel: Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
Joey: Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
Rachel: (yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!
[Scene: Ross, Charlie and Professor Spafford are sitting at the table in a restaurant]
Professor Spafford: (speaking very slowly) And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
Ross: (very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
Professor Spafford: And that's not all I'm allergic to.
Ross: (to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!
Professor Spafford: I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
Ross: So basically all nuts?
Professor Spafford: Interestingly... no.
Charlie: Kinda playing fast and loose with the word ""interesting"".
Professor Spafford: If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. (he goes away)
Charlie: Oh my God!!
Ross: I've lost the will to live.
Charlie: Let's ditch him!
Ross: What?
Charlie: Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
Ross: Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
Charlie: Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! (they run outside)
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]
Ross: (entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
Phoebe: Hi!
Ross: Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
Phoebe: Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
Charlie: Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...
Phoebe: Ah, ah.
Charlie: (her mobile phone rings) Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. (she cuts herself off for a moment)
Ross: (to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?
Phoebe: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
Monica: (to Ross) So, did you two have fun?
Ross: Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
Monica: And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!
Rachel: (she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
Ross: Really? Wh-what's wrong?
Rachel: I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
Charlie: Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.
Rachel: ... Ok, who is this?
Ross: I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
Rachel: Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
Monica: Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Rachel: Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...
Monica: You're not sick!
Rachel: What? Yes, I am!
Monica: Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??
Rachel: When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)
Monica: You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Rachel: Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
Monica: Ok, what is this?
Rachel: Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
Monica: (aloud) WHAT?
Ross: (looking at them) Wh-what's going on?
Monica: Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Rachel: And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
Charlie: I thought you came to say you were sick.
Rachel: Ok professor or detective?
Phoebe: Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Rachel: Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
Phoebe: And that horrible museum tour!
Ross: No, I arranged that...
(Joey enters, wearing a bathrobe)Joey: (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
Phoebe: We know about your party Joey.
Joey: What party?
Monica: The game's over! Take off your robe!
Joey: (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...
Everyone: No!! Cover it up!!
Joey: (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)
[Scene: The Roof]
Joey: (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming.
Monica: Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Kyle Lowder: (to Monica) Hi. (walks on)
Monica: (Yells after him) I love you!
Joey: Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
Monica: Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: (Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
Phoebe: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)
Monica: (Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!
[Scene: The theater. Chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously]
Chandler: Where the hell is everybody?
(The lights dim and Chandler tries to get away but as the bitter lady comes on stage and starts yelling he promptly changes his mind and sits down)Bitter lady: (yelling) Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
[Scene: The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it]
Monica: (to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this ""best wishes"" crap. I want ""love"".
Rachel: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
Monica: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Matthew Ashford: It was nice to meet you Rachel.
Rachel: Nice to meet you.
Matthew Ashford: Call me.
Rachel: Ok
(Matthew leaves)Monica: (yelling after him) We will!!
Monica: (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!
Rachel: Yeah!
Monica: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Rachel: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
Monica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)
(cut to Ross and Charlie)Ross: (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Charlie: Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.
Ross: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Charlie: Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
Ross: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Charlie: Yeah...
Ross: ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Charlie: Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
Ross: Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Charlie: Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...
Ross: (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood"".
Charlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
Ross: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Charlie: A guy who won two.
Ross: (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
Charlie: Yeah... for three years.
Ross: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
Charlie: (smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
Ross: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
Charlie: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
Ross: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
Phoebe: Hey Ross!
Rache: How is it going with Charlie?
Ross: (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Phoebe: Oh, What's the matter?
Ross: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
Rachel: I always loved that!!
Ross: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
Phoebe: Worse?
Ross: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) ""Can we walk""? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?
Phoebe: (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
Ross: What? (turns around to look at Rachel)
Rachel: Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)
[Scene: Chandler in the theater]
Bitter lady: Well, I bet you are all thinkin' ""Now would be a really great time for an intermission"", huh?
Chandler: (To himself) oh yes, God yes!!
Bitter lady: (now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder) How could he leave me?!?!
Chandler: I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
[Scene: The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy]
Joey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)
Ross: Nice to meet you.
Dirk: Hey! So what show are you on?
Ross: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
(Dirk is confused)Joey: It's a science.
Dirk: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on ""Days"". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.
(Ross looks annoyed hearing that even Dirk's character won a Nobel prize)Joey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
Ross: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
Dirk: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
Ross: I'd lead with that.
(Cut to Monica holding up her shirt, revealing her bra. An actor stands beside her, holding a pen in his hand.)Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).
Joey: Monica!
Monica: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
(Joey, resigned, walks to Rachel's table)Joey: (To Rachel) What have you got there?
Ross: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Joey: Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
Rachel: (drunken voice) I think I am.
Joey: (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
(Rachel is puzzled)Joey: (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
Rachel: (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
Joey: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
Rachel: Joey, you're so sweet.
Joey: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
Rachel: Who (looks around)?
(Joey motions for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)Joey: Me.
Rachel: (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?
Joey: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
Rachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)
Joey: Gotcha.
Rachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey.
(Joey leaves. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)(Chandler walks in)Chandler: (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?
Monica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
Chandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Monica: You really liked it?
Chandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", I was uplifted.
Monica: Oh really!
Chandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
Monica: No!
Chandler: Did somebody sign your bra?
Monica: So I got it when I was 13...
[Scene: At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.]
Phoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
Ross: It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
Phoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, 
slum it with some average Joe Phd.
Ross: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
Phoebe: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
Ross: And sexy.
Phoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
Ross: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
Phoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
Ross: Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
(Rachel approaches Monica)Rachel: (to Monica) Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Rachel: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
Monica: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Rachel: Please, what about you and Chandler?
Monica: That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Rachel: Well hello (points to herself)!
Monica: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Rachel: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Monica: Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Rachel: (pause) I'm gonna do it.
Monica: And I can't stop you.
Rachel: No.
(Rachel goes look for Joey. She sees him and Charlie kissing passionately.)Ross: (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
(Rachel just stands there staring at Joey and Charlie in silence. After a while, Ross turns around and sees them.)Ross: I'm smarter than him!
Closing credits[Scene: The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line]
Phoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Chandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Monica: Oh, you're so wonderful.
Bitter woman: Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
Chandler: Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).

[Scene: Central Perk]
Monica: It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? 
  I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
Ross: Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
Chandler: I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?
Ross: Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did 
  not kiss.
Rachel: I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls 
  at the party, GOD!
Ross: Why do you care so much?
Monica: Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Rachel: (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... 
  and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying 
  is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
Ross: Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each 
  other's tonsils...
Phoebe: Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids 
  and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, 
  those nerds will get laaaaaid!
Rachel: All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
Ross: Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with 
  it...
(Joey and Charlie enter. Ross looks at her) 
  Ross: Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Joey: Hey!
All: Hi!
Ross: I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Charlie: Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
Ross: Ok. (they both go)
Chandler: (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?
Joey: Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious 
  (which, being Joey, he mispronounces ""amonious""). (pause) That's not 
  how she used it...?
Charlie: (talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't 
  ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. 
  I really hope you don't think less of me.
Ross: Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, 
  you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like 
  someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
Charlie: You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, 
  Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, 
  and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you 
  know, very cerebral...
Ross: Yeah, I know the type.
Joey: Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. 
  No? Am I getting close?

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment]
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of 
  slippers)
Rachel: Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Phoebe: I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania 
  Twain.
Rachel: (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Phoebe: Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
Monica: Hey, what's this?
Rachel: Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Monica: Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage 
  chains.
Rachel: Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things 
  that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
Monica: Do you wanna go hunting?
Rachel: Well, I would like to have the option!!
Phoebe: (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift 
  certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!
Rachel: Oh!
Phoebe: No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these ""big 
  massage places""! They're putting people like me out of business!
Monica: And she wants to go hunting, too!!
Rachel: Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing 
  away a hundred bucks!
Phoebe: Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's 
  about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
Rachel: I don't care about any of that!!
Phoebe: Well, do you care about friendship?
Rachel: Oh!
Phoebe: I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use 
  this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
Rachel: Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
Phoebe: Promise?
Rachel: I promise.
Phoebe: Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
Rachel: But I am going hunting!!
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]
Monica: (entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!
Chandler: Oh, yeah?
Monica: Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?
Chandler: Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the 
  table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)
Monica: Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! 
  Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need 
  to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Chandler: We really need to take those tests?
Monica: Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think 
  it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
Chandler: But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Monica: What is the big deal?
Chandler: It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Monica: It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do 
  it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Chandler: (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) 
  And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Monica: Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think 
  it's a good idea!
Chandler: Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than 
  on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Monica: (really embarrassed) OH!
Chandler: Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
[Scene: Joey's apartment]
Joey: (sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost 
  more than milk!
(somebody knocks the door, Joey opens and it's Charlie) 
Joey: Heeey!
Charlie: Hi!
Joey: Come on in, how are ya?
Charlie: I'm good!
Joey: Can I offer you a drink?
Charlie: Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with 
  the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword 
  for a friend's book...
Joey: Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to 
  open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!
Charlie: So I am just so excited to be 
  here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
Joey: Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)
Charlie: Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
Joey: Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
Charlie: Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher 
  Hall.
Joey: (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!
Charlie: And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display 
  at the public library.
Joey: I know, yeah!
Charlie: And first, I have to see the MET!
Joey: Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna 
  see the Yankees.
Charlie: No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
Joey: Which one, they all suck!
Charlie: The museum!
Joey: (looking puzzled) I don't think so.
[Scene: SPA massage center, Rachel enters]
Rachel: (to the receptionist) Hi there!
Receptionist: (in an affected tone) Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa 
  SPA. How may I help you?
Rachel: Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and 
  here is my gift certificate.
Receptionist: This has been torn up.
Rachel: And... taped back together.
Receptionist: Ok well, I'll call you as 
  soon as your massage therapist is ready.
Rachel: Ok
Receptionist: Have a seat through the glass doors.
Rachel: (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.
Receptionist: Through the glass doors.
Rachel: Alright-y then.
(Phoebe enters the hall) 
Receptionist: Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
Phoebe: Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She 
  sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone 
  who can fill in for me?
Receptionist: Sorry, everyone is booked!
Phoebe: But that woman can't know I work 
  here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this 
  massage chains are.
Receptionist: Then why you work here?
Phoebe: 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that 
  this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Receptionist: Well, I think this is a great place to work!
Phoebe: (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?
[Scene: Central Perk]
(Joey walks in and moves towards Ross, who's sitting of the sofa) 
Joey: Ross!
Ross: Hi!
Joey: I need to talk to you about Charlie.
Ross: (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?
Joey: Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
Ross: Look, if you don't know what the word ""acrimonious"" 
  means, just don't use it!
Joey: No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her 
  body is soo...
Ross: Get to the problem!
Joey: Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've 
  ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
Ross: (looking down) Are you wearing two belts?
Joey: (checking) EH, what do you know!
Ross: You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Joey: Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural 
  places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
Ross: You know, I really don't want to 
  get involved in you guy's relationship.
Joey: Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really 
  like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
Ross: (after a short hesitation) Fine.
Joey: Thanks.
Ross: Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Joey: The Metsss!
Ross: Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Joey: (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're 
  gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, 
  and avoid all the confusion!
Ross: Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry 
  baseball fans!
Joey: Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
Ross: Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore 
  on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, 
  you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the 
  Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that 
  she'd love.
Joey: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
Ross: But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for 
  Thai food...
Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too 
  fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
Ross: Ok.
Joey: You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
Ross: Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities 
  wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make 
  the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the 
  right and Joey nods)
[Scene: doctor's waiting room]
Chandler: I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I 
  know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Monica: Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody 
  is gonna wanna watch that.
(a nurse walks in)
Nurse: Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that 
  room and deposit your specimen into the container.
Chandler: Deposit my specimen? You know, 
  usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind 
  of talk. Thanks, got it.
Monica: Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going 
  to be ok?
Chandler: Yeah, I guess!
Monica: I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even 
  knows you!
Janice: OH MY GOD!!
Chandler: Oh, Come on!
Commercial Break
Janice: Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
Monica: Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
Chandler: Why are you here?
Janice: Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time 
  because apparently we...
Chandler: (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is 
  she here??
Janice: Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz 
  they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking 
  at the cup in his hand).
Chandler: What!?
(Janice does her ""Janice Laugh"") 
Monica: This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! 
  (leaves)
Chandler: I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got 
  a hot date... (starts to leave)
Janice: Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you 
  need a hand!
Chandler: (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)
[Scene: At the Spa, Phoebe is at the half-opened door]
Phoebe: (In a strange heavy accent) Hello ""ja"", it's time 
  for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
Rachel: Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her 
  head in the hole and Phoebe enters)
Phoebe: Okay, then I'm Swedish...
Monica: So, what's your name?
Phoebe: It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
Rachel: Oh... what an interesting name.
Phoebe: Ja!
Rachel: You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's 
  direction)
Phoebe: (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!
Rachel: (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love 
  your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)
Phoebe: Is something wrong?
Rachel: No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) 
  Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
Phoebe: (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.
Rachel: Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
[Scene: Joey's apartment, Joey and Ross in the living room, 
  rehearsing what Joey will say to Charlie in the Museum]
Joey: (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly 
  lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors 
  as his elusive subject was light itself.
Ross: Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
Joey: (shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth 
  says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Ross: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt 
  M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Joey: Phonetically? (Looks confused)
Ross: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time 
  for this.
Joey: Ok.
Ross: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, 
  I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Joey: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days"" 
  I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"".
Ross: Wow. What does that mean?
Joey: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I 
  guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear"".
Ross: Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Joey: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish 
  of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the 
  imaginary painting).
Ross: Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing 
  and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
Joey: Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
Ross: No! (Slaps his hand)
[Scene: The Fertility Clinic; Chandler walks out one of the rooms]
Chandler: (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the 
  room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. 
  Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees 
  Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?
Janice: Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so 
  this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
Chandler: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Janice: That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes 
  next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
Chandler: I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... 
  I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Janice: Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
Chandler: (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there 
  is a reason why we can't have a baby?
Janice: Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. 
  I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
Chandler: (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe 
  I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... 
  come here and do... 'that'...
Janice: What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you 
  can't do it at a doctor's office?
Chandler: (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a ""Wendy's!! 
  ""
[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa. Phoebe is still massaging 
  Rachel]
Phoebe: (Singing) ""Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! "" And that is 
  the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
Rachel: Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have 
  a friend who is a masseuse.
Phoebe: Oh, Ja! Ja!
Rachel: Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)
Phoebe: Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
Rachel: I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy 
  fingers from playing crummy guitar...
Phoebe: Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're 
  such a high maintenance tight ass!
Rachel: (now lifts her head) Phoebe!!
Phoebe: You know it's me?
Rachel: For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
Phoebe: How can you come here?
Rachel: How could you not tell me you worked here?
Phoebe: I don't have to tell you everything!
Rachel: Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting 
  a free massage!
Phoebe: Tips not included.
Rachel: Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Phoebe: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then 
  they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... 
  you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! 
  paying taxes!
Rachel: Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there 
  right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles 
  and I so admire that! I don't have any!
Phoebe: You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time 
  I took my life back!
Rachel: Good for you Pheebs!
Phoebe: Ok.
Phoebe: Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and 
  whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any 
  of that. I love you.
[Scene: Central Perk. Ross is playing some shoot'em up game on 
  his laptop]
Ross: Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
(Charlie walks in.) 
Ross: (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor 
  R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the 
  sofa) Hey!
Charlie: Hi!
Ross: Hey, how was the Met?
Charlie: The museum was amazing!
Ross: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
Charlie: Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to 
  say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
Ross: What do you mean?
Charlie: Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere 
  around.
Ross: (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked 
  into the Met, did you go to the right?
Charlie: No, we went to the left.
Ross: (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like 
  you guys are having a great time together.
Charlie: Yeah, it's fun (hesitating).
Ross: What?
Charlie: Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really 
  know me that well; it would be weird.
Ross: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
Charlie: Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy 
  to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common 
  with. You know what I mean?
Ross: (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey 
  a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about 
  art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
Charlie: Yeah, I guess that's true.
Ross: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all 
  that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You 
  know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
Charlie: He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
Ross: That was going to be my next argument.
(Joey walks in) 
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Charlie: Hey!
Joey: (to Charlie) You're ready?
Charlie: Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks 
  Ross.
Joey: (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me 
  up.
Ross: Glad I could help man.
Joey: Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna 
  be, but... (confidently) I made it work.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa, 
  reading the newspaper.]
Chandler: (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited 
  his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
(phone rings) 
Chandler: Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here 
  but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile 
  fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) 
  Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)
(Monica walks in) 
Monica: Hey sweetie.
Chandler: Doctor Connelly just called.
Monica: With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course 
  it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) ""Doctor Connelly just called"". 
  If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) ""Doctor Connelly just 
  called! "" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem 
  with me or with you?
Chandler: Actually it's both of us.
Monica: What?
Chandler: Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable 
  environment.
Monica: Oh... what does that mean?
Chandler: It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers 
  and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It 
  means...
Monica: Chandler?
Chandler: (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's 
  a good chance this may never happen for us.
Monica: (weeping) Oh my God!
Chandler: I'm sorry.
Monica: I'm sorry too.
(they hug) 
Chandler: Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
Monica: (still weeping) I know.
Closing credits
[Scene: The Spa Reception. Phoebe walks in]
Receptionist: Good morning Phoebe.
Phoebe: (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.
Receptionist: Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is 
  in room No. 1.
Phoebe: Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?
(Phoebe walks to the door and half-opens it) 
Phoebe: (through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for 
  your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.

Gynecologist Dr. Connelly tells Chandler and Monica they should keep trying the natural way, but realistically consider a surrogate mother -a nightmare for Monica- or donor sperm insemination, so Chandler invites his 'perfectly eligible' colleague Zach for dinner; they scare him with ...",08-May-03,"-3,603","

[Scene: Central Perk. Charlie, Joey and Rachel are on the couches]
Charlie: (while Joey's giving her a massage) Oh! That feels sooo good!
Rachel: (speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Charlie: I'm sorry, what?
Rachel: Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
Charlie: From... Cosmo??
Rachel: Yeah, yeah... It's... ""climax your way to better skin"".
Charlie: (to Joey) So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!
Joey: So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Rachel: (hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
Joey: Oh hey Rach!
Rachel: Yeah...
Joey: Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Rachel: Oh, well...
Charlie: I'm sure you have better things to do.
Joey: Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
Charlie: If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
Rachel: Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Joey: (to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
Phoebe: (entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?
Joey: What's the matter, Pheebs?
Phoebe: Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like ""Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!"". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
Rachel: Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Phoebe: Exactly!
Rachel: And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
Phoebe: (after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh, sexual politics!!
Rachel: Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Phoebe: Ok, that'll be great!
Joey: Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Rachel: That's not what we're gonna do!
Joey: Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
Opening credits[Scene: Doctor Connelly's office]
Chandler: (looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
Monica: Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Chandler: Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
Doctor Connelly: (entering) Hi there.
Chandler: Hi.
Monica: Hi.
Doctor Connelly: I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
Monica: Ok.
Doctor Connelly: Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
Chandler: Oh, DAMN IT!
(Dr. Connelly glares at Chandler)
Monica: Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
Doctor Connelly: Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
Monica: (long pause) Ok.
Doctor Connelly: And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
Chandler: Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
[Scene: Central Perk. Joey and Charlie on the couch. Rachel enters]
Rachel: Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
Charlie: Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
Joey: (to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)
Rachel: Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Ross: (entering) Hey, you guys!
Rachel: Hi.
Ross: Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Charlie: Umh... Kurts Baley?
Ross: Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?
Joey: Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
Charlie: So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
Ross: Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
Charlie: He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
Ross: Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
Rachel: Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
Ross: Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).
Chandler: (entering) Hey guys!
Ross: Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Chandler: I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
Ross: It's in Barbados.
Chandler: But you come first!
Rachel: I'm there!
Charlie: We'll see you, guys! (she goes)
Joey: Bye.
Rachel: Bye, see ya. (she goes)
Chandler: (sitting down on the couch) Ok.
Joey: All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
Chandler: Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Ross: So-so what did the doctor say?
Chandler: Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
Joey: So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: So, I don't have to learn what that means?
Chandler: Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
Joey: Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Chandler: (stopping Joey) ah-ha!
Ross: How do you feel about all this?
Chandler: I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Joey: Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
Ross: (puzzled) What?
(Joey moves close to Ross and whispers something in his ear)
Ross: (looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
[Scene: Professor Sherman's office, Ross is relating to Professor Sherman]
Ross: The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
Professor Sherman: Mmm-mm.
Ross: (reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
(Turns to look at Professor Sherman, only to discover that he is sleeping)
Ross: Oh, that's not what you want...
[Scene: Shop, Rachel, Charlie and Phoebe walk in]
Shop assistant: (to a girl) Incentive For Men?
Phoebe: Oh, I'll take some of that.
Rachel: Pheebs, that's for men!
Phoebe: No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.
(The shop assistant sprays the perfume on Phoebe's neck)
Phoebe: Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
Charlie: (to Rachel) So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?
Rachel: On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here.
Charlie: See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a ""thank you"", I would really love to take you out.
Rachel: Really?
Charlie: Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?
Rachel: Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Charlie: You've seen all the movies...
Rachel: Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
Phoebe: (picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
Rachel: Sure!
Phoebe: Ok!
Charlie: Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
Rachel: You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
(Phoebe and Rachel go off to the dressing rooms. They enter one and close the curtain.)
Phoebe: So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
Rachel: She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
Phoebe: Why?
Rachel: I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
Phoebe: Who else?
Rachel: Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Phoebe: You like Joey?
Rachel: Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
Phoebe: (whispering) Oh my God!
Rachel: It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!
Phoebe: Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
Rachel: (annoyed) Oh, I get it!
Phoebe: Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
Rachel: I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: So can we keep this between us?
Phoebe: Sure!
Rachel: Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
Phoebe: Oh.
(Rachel opens the curtains and sees Charlie coming out from the dressing room just next to theirs)
Phoebe: Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
[Scene: Monica's apartment, Chandler walks in with a friend of his while Monica is putting fruit in a bowl.]
Monica: Hi honey!
Chandler: Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
Monica: Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
Zack: (shaking Monica's hand) You too.
Chandler: You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
Monica: I got it.
Zack: Thanks.
Chandler: (to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
Monica: Yeah, I guess.
Chandler: So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Monica: (turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?
Chandler: Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!
Monica: Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!
Chandler: No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
Monica: Chandler!
Chandler: I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Monica: I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
Chandler: Ok!
Monica: Uh!
Chandler: (bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!
Zack: Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
(Monica hears that and is suddenly very interested in Zack)
Monica: Tell me about yourself, Zack!
[Scene: Shop, Phoebe and Rachel are talking in front of the dressing room]
Rachel: Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
Phoebe: Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
Rachel: Ok, great!
(Phoebe moves in the dressing room from which Charlie went out)
Rachel: Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Phoebe: (sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!
Rachel: (sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!
Phoebe: (goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Rachel: (comes out again) What!?
Phoebe: (comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Rachel: Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Phoebe: Ooh! We have a problem.
Rachel: Oh! What are we gonna do?
(A strange woman sticks her head out from a third changing cubicle to the far right)
Stranger: Just be honest with her.
Rachel: Oh my God!
Stranger: And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
Rachel: (yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey is sitting on his bed and the phone rings]
Joey: Hello?
Ross: Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Joey: No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Ross: I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Joey: Oh! How's it going?
Ross: It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
Joey: What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Ross: Barbados.
Joey: Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Ross: What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Joey: Well, just wake him up!
Ross: I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
Joey: Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartement. Chandler and the guest are in the living room, Monica in the kitchen]
Monica: Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
Zack: Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. (Chandler points him the bathroom) Thanks!
Chandler: So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
Monica: Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
Chandler: You don't like him.
Monica: I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
Chandler: Alright! Just follow my lead!
(Zack comes out of the bathroom. They all sit down at the table.)
Zack: You guys have such a great place here.
Chandler: Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
Zack: Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for 
Dukakis.
Chandler: (very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Zack: (looking very puzzled) Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
Monica: Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
Zack: (after a pause, very confused) No...
Monica: Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
Zack: You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?
Monica: We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
Zack: Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
Chandler: You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an ""ok"" sign)
Zack: Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
Monica & Chandler: Sure! Alright...
Zack: Ravioli's delicious!
Chandler: I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Zack: No I didn't.
Monica: Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)
Chandler: (Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!
[Scene: In the store. Rachel and Phoebe returning from the changing rooms]
Rachel: Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
Phoebe: Good plan.
Rachel: Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Phoebe: Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""! (at which she walks away)
Rachel: (to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
Charlie: Oh! trying on clothes.
Rachel: (pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!
Charlie: (smiling) Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
Rachel: Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
Charlie: No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
Rachel: (after a pause) Yeah.
Charlie: It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?
Rachel: Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
Charlie: Wow!
Rachel: Yeah...
Charlie: You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.
Rachel: (Looks ashamed) I try...
[Scene: Prof. Sherman's office. Sherman is still asleep on his chair, blocking the door.]
(Ross takes his suitcase and tries to get out but ends up falling on Prof. Sherman's laps, thereby waking him up)
Ross: (To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
Prof. Sherman: (confused) You're welcome. (Ross hugs him again)
[Scene: Central Perk. Joey is sitting on the sofa, eating a cookie.]
(Phoebe walks in wearing a fancy, revealing dress, and stands before Joey)
Joey: (impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Phoebe: Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Joey: Then don't go!
Phoebe: Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
Joey: Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
Phoebe: You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
(Joey gives Phoebe a thumbs up. Phoebe walks out)
[Scene: Outside Central Perk.]
Phoebe: David?
(David the scientist guy is standing at the news-stand)
David: Phoebe! Hi!
Phoebe: Oh my God! (they hug)
David: Wow, you look unbelievable.
Phoebe: Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
David: Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
Phoebe: What happened?
David: Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Phoebe: Yeah?
David: Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
Phoebe: Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
David: Good, good, life is good...
Phoebe: Good!
David: Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
Phoebe: (disappointed) Oh, good for you.
David: She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said ""Boy, I want that"".
Phoebe: Mike and I broke up.
David: You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.
Phoebe: Really?
David: Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
Phoebe: I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!
David: Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
Phoebe: Well... (pause) no.
David: Do you wanna get a drink?
Phoebe: I'd love to.
David: Great.
Phoebe: Ok. (they walk away together)
David: Do you smell beets?
Phoebe: Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
(Charlie and Rachel arrive. They see David and Phoebe leave)
Charlie: Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
Rachel: No, that's David.
Charlie: There's a third guy?
Rachel: (disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.
[Cut to Monica and Chandler's]
Zack: I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
Chandler: You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Zack: No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.
Chandler: Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
Zack: No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.
Chandler: Ok.
(Zack leaves)
Chandler: I think we've found our sperm!
Monica: Does seem pretty perfect.
Chandler: Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
Monica: (pause) No.
Chandler: Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Monica: No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
Chandler: Yeah, he's better!
Monica: No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Chandler: Really? Are you sure?
Monica: Yeah, I'm sure.
Chandler: (sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
Monica: That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)
Chandler: So you know this leaves us with...
Monica: Adoption.
Chandler: How do you feel about that?
Monica: I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
Chandler: Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Monica: So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Chandler: (smiling) Yeah.
Monica: (excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
Chandler: We are gonna be great parents.
Monica: And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived.
Chandler: Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
(they hug)
Closing credits[Scene: Zack's office]
Chandler: Hey, Zack!
Zack: (hardly enthusiastic) Hey Chandler.
Chandler: Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
Zack: No you didn't.
Chandler: Really?
Zack: No you did.
Chandler: My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
(Zack's pregnant secretary, Jeanette, walks in)
Jeanette: (to Zack) Here are the boards for Friday's pitch (hands him something).
Zack: Oh, thank you.
(Jeanette walks out)
Chandler: You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?

[Scene: Central Perk]
Joey: (entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Ross: Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Joey: Mmh-mmh.
Ross: (to Emma) Can you say Barbados?
Joey: Barbados!
Ross: Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! (he gives them their passes) This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Rachel: Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Chandler: Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff"".
Phoebe: I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Ross: Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
Phoebe: No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
Ross: Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Joey: All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
Ross: It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
Opening credits[Scene: Paradise Hotel lounge in Barbados]
Charlie: Wow! This place is beautiful!
Ross: (very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!
Joey: I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)
Woman: Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
Joey: (to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
Woman: Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
Joey: That... never happens...
Woman: I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
Ross: Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
Woman: I would love your autograph. (hands him a notepad)
Ross: Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... ""Dear..."" (he takes the notepad)
Woman: Sarah.
Ross: ""... Sarah. I dig you"", Uh? ""Doctor Ross Geller"".
Sarah: Thank you so much!
Ross: Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
Sarah: (to Joey) Are you a paleontologist?
Joey: No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives"".
Ross: Dude, it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the.
Joey: (thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
Sarah: I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
Joey: You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
[Scene: Central Perk]
Monica: David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
David: Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
Monica: (to Chandler) See?
Chandler: Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind"".
Monica: Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Phoebe: Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
(Everyone looks at her)
Phoebe: Mike?? Who's Mike?
David: Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
Phoebe: That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
David: It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
Phoebe: Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
Chandler: (upset) She does?
Monica: (pinching her) Let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)
(Outside the Central Perk)
Monica: At least you took me down with you!
Phoebe: I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
Monica: I guess, in time.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Monica: I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Phoebe: You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
[Scene: Inside Central Perk]
David: (to Chandler) Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
Chandler: I wouldn't read too much into it.
David: Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
Chandler: David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
David: Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...
Chandler: Seriously, we're gonna do this?
David: I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
Chandler: Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
David: That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
Chandler: What?
David: Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
Chandler: I didn't mean now...
David: Why not? It's brilliant! (talking to an imaginary Mike) Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! (pause) well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... (to Chandler) Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
Chandler: Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
David: (after a while) How do you think I should propose?
Chandler: David, I'm pretending to read here!!
[Scene: Joey in his hotel in room in Barbados]
(Trying on a hat and talking to his own reflection in the mirror)
Joey: Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
(Charlie comes out the bathroom)
Joey: Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
Charlie: (laughing) I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
Joey: You really should have been more clear about that!
(Someone knocks the door, Joey goes to open it and Ross is on the other side)
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: (Excited) You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Joey: Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Ross: Yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Charlie: Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
Ross: Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Joey: You could say: ""Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"" (looks at Ross matter-of-factly)
Ross: (to Charlie) Ready to go?
Charlie: Yeah!
Joey: Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
Charlie: Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
Ross: Yeah.
Charlie: But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
Joey: (smiling) Will you wear a thong?
Charlie: I will if you will.
Joey: Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Ross: (a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them).
Charlie: So you'll be ok?
Joey: Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
Ross: Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
Joey: No, why?
(Ross goes to the window and opens the curtains revealing that it's raining outside)
Joey: Oh man!
Charlie: There's an indoor pool, you can swim there! (Ross agrees)
Joey: I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)
[Scene: Back in New York, Monica and Chandler in Central Perk on the couch]
Monica: Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Chandler: (smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do"" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) ""I do"".
Monica: Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
Chandler: David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Monica: What? (looks very shocked) Why?
Chandler: Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Monica: Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Chandler: I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
Monica: They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
Chandler: Man, that's some bad advice!
[Scene: Barbados, hotel lounge. David, Phoebe and Rachel have just arrived.]
(Joey spots them and walks towards them)
Joey: Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Rachel: Hey! Hey what's going on?
Joey: Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
(Rachel turns around and sees Chandler and Monica arriving)
Rachel: Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
(Monica and Chandler reach the group)
Monica: Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
Chandler: That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Joey: Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)
Monica: (to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
Phoebe: (shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
Monica: (shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe).
Rachel: Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could (looks at Joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy.
Phoebe: Not Joey.
Rachel: Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
Monica: Yeah, right!
[Cut to the guys]
David: So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight. (Removes a ring box from his pocket and opens it to show Chandler the ring)
Chandler: Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!
David: Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.
Chandler: (slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)
Chandler: Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)
Monica: Ok!
Chandler: David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Monica: See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Chandler: That would be advice!!
Monica: Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Monica: (looking very serious) I need to talk to you.
Phoebe: Are you leaving ""The Supremes""? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)
MOnica: Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
Phoebe: Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
Monica: What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Phoebe: Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: ""Mike, do you take Phoebe..."" (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout ""No! No!"") You know, it's every girl's dream!
Monica: Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Phoebe: Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
[Scene: Ross's hotel room. Ross and is reading his keynote speech to Charlie from his laptop]
Ross: By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
Charlie: It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
Ross: Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler).
Joey: Hey guys!
Ross: The chocolates aren't here yet.
Joey: Damnit!
Charlie: Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
Chandler: Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
Ross: If you want to check your email, just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)
Chandler: (offended) What? (pause) May I?
Rachel: (looking out the window) What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
Charlie: Actually the wet season is June to December.
Rachel: It's not the time Charlie.
Chandler: (at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
Joey: Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh! Secret teapot?
Chandler: Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
Ross: Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)
Chandler: It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Ross: What, oh my God. What did you do?
Chandler: Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Ross: Why, why would you open it?
Chandler: Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!
Ross: What did it say?
Chandler: Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Ross: What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
Chandler: It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
Ross: NO! I don't!!
Chandler: Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
[Time lapse: Ross looks likes he's been trying to fix his computer but just closes it as if giving up]
Joey: It's really gone?
Ross: Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Chandler: I just feel awful.
Ross: Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
Chandler: Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same ""I'm gonna kill you"" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)
Ross: Get out! (Chandler runs out)
Rachel: You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Ross: Well, what do you do?
Rachel: Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
Ross: I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Joey: I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Ross: I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Charlie: Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
Ross: Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Charlie: Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner (Looks at Joey).
Joey: Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
Rachel: Ugh.
Ross: Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Joey: Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far, far away""? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave).
[Scene: Mike's apartment. His phone rings and he picks up]
Mike: Hello?
Monica: Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!
Mike: Who is this?
Monica: This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!
Mike: (sounds shocked and sits down) He... he's gonna propose?
Monica: I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)
Mike: Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
Monica: You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? (Mike hangs up the phone) Damnit!
(Chandler walks in)
Monica: (sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!
Chandler: (pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Monica: Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Chandler: Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? That's, that's great!
Monica: No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
Chandler: And there's not chance that will work?
Monica: No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
Chandler: (pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Monica: Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Chandler: This vacation sucks!!
[Scene: The hall, full of paleontologists. Rachel and Joey are walking around]
Joey: I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Rachel: Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Joey: Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
(A waiter walks by carrying appetizers or something on a tray)
Joey: (stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
Waiter: I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention (walks away)
Joey: Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
Rachel: We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Joey: (walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba...
Rachel: (picking up another random badge) Kate Miller?
Joey: Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)
Rachel: And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Joey: In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)
Rachel: Thank you. (they walk away)
[Scene: Ross's room. Charlie is sitting on the bed, while Ross is walking up and down nervously]
Charlie: And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
Ross: Yeah, that's it?
Charlie: Yeah.
Ross: Oh my God, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)
Charlie: Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
Ross: Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's a pretty necklace.
Charlie: Thank you.
Ross: Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)
Charlie: Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.
Ross: Oh my God, I love you.
Charlie: Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
Ross: That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Charlie: Your first marriage?
Ross: Yeah.
Charlie: You're married more than once?
Ross: No. (they clink glasses and drink)
Charlie: So, why did you break up?
Ross: (embarassed) Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
Charlie: Oh my God, this is so cool!
Ross: Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Charlie: No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!
Ross: Hey! High-five! (they high-five)
Charlie: Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fianc√© was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
Ross: My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Charlie: Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: ""Oh, I knew all along""
Ross: I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: ""Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay""
Charlie: I know!
Ross: And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
Charlie: I didn't do that.
Ross: (embarassed) Me neither.
[Scene: the Pharmacist convention. Joey and Rachel are walking out of it, drinking cocktails]
Joey: Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
Rachel: I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Joey: Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
Rachel: Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
Joey: But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
Rachel: (takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) No.
Joey: There it is, you're blushing!
Rachel: No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
Joey: You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)
Rachel: No.
Joey: Tell me who it is.
Rachel: Joey! (she walks away; Joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)
Joey: Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
Rachel: Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Joey: What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
Rachel: Oh! (pause) Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
Joey: (eagerly) Yeah, who is that?
Rachel: Do ya?
Joey: Yeah.
(Ross and Charlie walk into the hall from Ross's room)
Ross and Charlie: Hey!
(Joey smiles at them. Rachel looks annoyed)
Charlie: (to Joey) I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
Joey: Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Ross: Yep, we got it, we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much.
Charlie: I had a great time.
Joey: Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
Rachel: Later! La...
Charlie: So, shall we?
Joey: Yeah. (they leave)
Rachel: Ok. See you, bye.
Charlie: Bye.
Ross: Good night.
Joey: Night.
(Ross and Rachel watch them walk away and sigh. They look at each other, embarassed.)
Ross and Rachel: Ok, good night!
[Scene: The restaurant. Chandler and Monica are sitting at a table]
(Phoebe and David walk in)
Monica: I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Chandler: You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
(David and Phoebe sit down at a table close to Chandler and Monica's)
David: Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
Monica: Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Chandler: I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) ""Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..."" Spit it out, David!
David: Uh, Phoebe, uh... (Chandler hits his own head) you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
Phoebe: Sure, ok, yeah.
David: But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...
(David produces the ring. At the same time, Mike walks in, behind David)
Phoebe: Oh my God, Mike!
David: It's David, actually!
Phoebe: No, Mike's here.
David: (turns around) Hi Mike!
Mike: Hi David. Chandler. Monica... (Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!
Monica: IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Mike: Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe: What are you, what are you doing here?
Mike: I have a question I need to ask you.
David: I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
Mike: Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
David: (annoyed) Ok, would you care for my seat as well?
Mike: Actually yeah, that'll be great.
David: That's fair, you've had a long trip. (he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)
Mike: Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
David: Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
Mike: Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
David: Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
Monica: You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring...
David: I have a ring.
Chandler: I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
David: Phoebe, will you marry me?
Phoebe: (smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!
David: Uhm... Ha ha!
Phoebe: I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
Mike: We can have any future you want.
(they hold their hands, gazing at each other)
David: Ok, I'm gonna take off.
Phoebe: David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
David: Just so I know, if I had asked first...
Phoebe: Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
David: Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! (he leaves)
Mike: Is it ok if I hug you now?
Phoebe: Yes! (they hug)
Monica: (to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's room. Monica and Chandler are in bed.]
Chandler: Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
Monica: I know (she snuggles to him)
(Rachel runs in)
Rachel: (walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Chandler: I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
(Rachel opens the drapes)
Monica: The sun is out!
Chandler: Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Monica: Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Chandler: Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Rachel: Nooo!
Monica: Damn it!
Ross: (from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!
[Scene: Conference room. Ross is making his keynote speech]
Ross: Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Rachel: Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
Ross: Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
Chandler: (to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.
(the paleontologist glares at Chandler)
Ross: And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
(all the paleontologists laugh)
Chandler: (to the one sitting next to him) Really?
Ross: But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
(Joey laughs)
Charlie: What?
Joey: He said ""erectus""!
Charlie: You're... you're kidding, right?
Joey: No, he really said it.
Ross: ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
(Rachel laughs)
Joey: Erectus?
Rachel: Homo.
[Scene: the hotel conference room]
Ross: (concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!
(Everybody stands up and applauds. Ross looks flattered and surprised. His friends and other members of the audience go to congratulate him)
Ross: Oh, thanks guys!
Man with a bow tie: (shaking hands with Ross) I thought... it was wonderful!
Ross: Oh!
Man with a bow tie: Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. (sighs) I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... (sighs again and smiles at Ross blissfully).
Ross: (with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)
Rachel: All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?
Monica: Yeah!
Rachel: (to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!
Ross: Oh, thank you so much!
Joey: Yeah, and so funny!
Rachel: Oh!
(Rachel, Joey and Chandler pat him on his shoulders and walk off, together with Monica)
Ross: (puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
Mike: (popping by, smiling) You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
(Ross is dumbfounded to see Mike instead of David)
Mike: Oh... I'm back!
Ross: (skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Phoebe & Mike: Yeah! (they leave)
(Ross goes towards Charlie, who's conversing with a fellow paleontologist, and touches her shoulder to get her attention)
Ross: Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)
Charlie: You were incredible!
Ross: Yeah?
Charlie: You blew them away!
Ross: Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?
Charlie: (smiling broadly) I was not!
Ross: No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Charlie: Oh my God! (pauses) I'm your groupie!
Ross: (joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
(Ross giggles, but Charlie isn't amused at all.)
Ross: (realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!
[Scene: the hotel lobby. Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Mike walk in from the outside.]
Monica: (her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
(They approach the buffet, where a couple of paleontologists are sipping their drinks)
Phoebe: Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!
(Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Mike walk away, sipping their drinks)
Monica: So, what are we gonna do today?
Mike: They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Monica: (pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
Chandler: I don't think so!
Monica: (disappointed) Why not?
Chandler: Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
Monica: I'm not always that bad!
Chandler: Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
Monica: (hesitatingly) I punched you...?
Chandler: And...?
Monica: ... Phoebe...?
Phoebe: ... and...?
Monica: I clunked your heads together!
(Chandler turns to Mike and gives him a ""See what I mean?"" look)
[Scene: Joey and Charlie's room]
(Joey is sitting in an armchair and wearing a diving mask. He pulls out a grape from a bunch of fake grapes on the coffee table, puts it on the snorkel's breathing tube and blows it out, then giggles to himself)
Charlie: (walking in) Hey! There you are!
Joey: Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)
Charlie: I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
Joey: (disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
Charlie: You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and (pauses) especially last night...
Joey: (interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)
Charlie: Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
Joey: (bewildered) Oh! O",
18,The One in Barbados,"To the other friends' fury, it keeps raining except during Ross's speech, which to their amazement is a big hit with the paleontologists. Joey's scientific ignorance decides Charlie to turn her favor to Ross, then they must flee the other academics who intend by tradition to throw the key note-speaker into the pool. Chandler and Phoebe knew better, but Mike accepts to play table tennis against ever-obsessive fluffy monster Monica; when she gets injured, Chandler jumps in and crushes Mike.

[Scene: Central Perk]
Joey: (entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Ross: Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Joey: Mmh-mmh.
Ross: (to Emma) Can you say Barbados?
Joey: Barbados!
Ross: Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! (he gives them their passes) This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Rachel: Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Chandler: Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff"".
Phoebe: I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Ross: Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
Phoebe: No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
Ross: Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Joey: All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
Ross: It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
Opening credits[Scene: Paradise Hotel lounge in Barbados]
Charlie: Wow! This place is beautiful!
Ross: (very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!
Joey: I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)
Woman: Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
Joey: (to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
Woman: Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
Joey: That... never happens...
Woman: I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
Ross: Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
Woman: I would love your autograph. (hands him a notepad)
Ross: Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... ""Dear..."" (he takes the notepad)
Woman: Sarah.
Ross: ""... Sarah. I dig you"", Uh? ""Doctor Ross Geller"".
Sarah: Thank you so much!
Ross: Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
Sarah: (to Joey) Are you a paleontologist?
Joey: No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives"".
Ross: Dude, it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the.
Joey: (thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
Sarah: I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
Joey: You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??

Monica: David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
David: Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
Monica: (to Chandler) See?
Chandler: Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind"".
Monica: Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Phoebe: Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
(Everyone looks at her)
Phoebe: Mike?? Who's Mike?
David: Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
Phoebe: That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
David: It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
Phoebe: Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
Chandler: (upset) She does?
Monica: (pinching her) Let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)
(Outside the Central Perk)
Monica: At least you took me down with you!
Phoebe: I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
Monica: I guess, in time.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Monica: I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Phoebe: You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
[Scene: Inside Central Perk]
David: (to Chandler) Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
Chandler: I wouldn't read too much into it.
David: Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
Chandler: David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
David: Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...
Chandler: Seriously, we're gonna do this?
David: I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
Chandler: Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
David: That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
Chandler: What?
David: Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
Chandler: I didn't mean now...
David: Why not? It's brilliant! (talking to an imaginary Mike) Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! (pause) well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... (to Chandler) Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
Chandler: Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
David: (after a while) How do you think I should propose?
Chandler: David, I'm pretending to read here!!
[Scene: Joey in his hotel in room in Barbados]
(Trying on a hat and talking to his own reflection in the mirror)
Joey: Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
(Charlie comes out the bathroom)
Joey: Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
Charlie: (laughing) I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
Joey: You really should have been more clear about that!
(Someone knocks the door, Joey goes to open it and Ross is on the other side)
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: (Excited) You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Joey: Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Ross: Yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Charlie: Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
Ross: Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Joey: You could say: ""Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"" (looks at Ross matter-of-factly)
Ross: (to Charlie) Ready to go?
Charlie: Yeah!
Joey: Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
Charlie: Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
Ross: Yeah.
Charlie: But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
Joey: (smiling) Will you wear a thong?
Charlie: I will if you will.
Joey: Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Ross: (a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them).
Charlie: So you'll be ok?
Joey: Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
Ross: Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
Joey: No, why?
(Ross goes to the window and opens the curtains revealing that it's raining outside)
Joey: Oh man!
Charlie: There's an indoor pool, you can swim there! (Ross agrees)
Joey: I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)
[Scene: Back in New York, Monica and Chandler in Central Perk on the couch]
Monica: Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Chandler: (smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do"" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) ""I do"".
Monica: Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
Chandler: David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Monica: What? (looks very shocked) Why?
Chandler: Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Monica: Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Chandler: I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
Monica: They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
Chandler: Man, that's some bad advice!
[Scene: Barbados, hotel lounge. David, Phoebe and Rachel have just arrived.]
(Joey spots them and walks towards them)
Joey: Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Rachel: Hey! Hey what's going on?
Joey: Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
(Rachel turns around and sees Chandler and Monica arriving)
Rachel: Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
(Monica and Chandler reach the group)
Monica: Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
Chandler: That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Joey: Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)
Monica: (to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
Phoebe: (shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
Monica: (shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe).
Rachel: Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could (looks at Joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy.
Phoebe: Not Joey.
Rachel: Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
Monica: Yeah, right!
[Cut to the guys]
David: So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight. (Removes a ring box from his pocket and opens it to show Chandler the ring)
Chandler: Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!
David: Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.
Chandler: (slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)
Chandler: Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)
Monica: Ok!
Chandler: David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Monica: See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Chandler: That would be advice!!
Monica: Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Monica: (looking very serious) I need to talk to you.
Phoebe: Are you leaving ""The Supremes""? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)
MOnica: Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
Phoebe: Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
Monica: What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Phoebe: Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: ""Mike, do you take Phoebe..."" (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout ""No! No!"") You know, it's every girl's dream!
Monica: Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Phoebe: Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
[Scene: Ross's hotel room. Ross and is reading his keynote speech to Charlie from his laptop]
Ross: By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
Charlie: It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
Ross: Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler).
Joey: Hey guys!
Ross: The chocolates aren't here yet.
Joey: Damnit!
Charlie: Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
Chandler: Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
Ross: If you want to check your email, just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)
Chandler: (offended) What? (pause) May I?
Rachel: (looking out the window) What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
Charlie: Actually the wet season is June to December.
Rachel: It's not the time Charlie.
Chandler: (at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
Joey: Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh! Secret teapot?
Chandler: Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
Ross: Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)
Chandler: It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Ross: What, oh my God. What did you do?
Chandler: Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Ross: Why, why would you open it?
Chandler: Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!
Ross: What did it say?
Chandler: Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Ross: What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
Chandler: It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
Ross: NO! I don't!!
Chandler: Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
[Time lapse: Ross looks likes he's been trying to fix his computer but just closes it as if giving up]
Joey: It's really gone?
Ross: Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Chandler: I just feel awful.
Ross: Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
Chandler: Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same ""I'm gonna kill you"" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)
Ross: Get out! (Chandler runs out)
Rachel: You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Ross: Well, what do you do?
Rachel: Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
Ross: I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Joey: I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Ross: I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Charlie: Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
Ross: Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Charlie: Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner (Looks at Joey).
Joey: Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
Rachel: Ugh.
Ross: Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Joey: Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far, far away""? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave).
[Scene: Mike's apartment. His phone rings and he picks up]
Mike: Hello?
Monica: Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!
Mike: Who is this?
Monica: This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!
Mike: (sounds shocked and sits down) He... he's gonna propose?
Monica: I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)
Mike: Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
Monica: You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? (Mike hangs up the phone) Damnit!
(Chandler walks in)
Monica: (sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!
Chandler: (pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Monica: Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Chandler: Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? That's, that's great!
Monica: No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
Chandler: And there's not chance that will work?
Monica: No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
Chandler: (pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Monica: Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Chandler: This vacation sucks!!
[Scene: The hall, full of paleontologists. Rachel and Joey are walking around]
Joey: I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Rachel: Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Joey: Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
(A waiter walks by carrying appetizers or something on a tray)
Joey: (stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
Waiter: I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention (walks away)
Joey: Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
Rachel: We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Joey: (walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba...
Rachel: (picking up another random badge) Kate Miller?
Joey: Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)
Rachel: And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Joey: In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)
Rachel: Thank you. (they walk away)
[Scene: Ross's room. Charlie is sitting on the bed, while Ross is walking up and down nervously]
Charlie: And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
Ross: Yeah, that's it?
Charlie: Yeah.
Ross: Oh my God, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)
Charlie: Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
Ross: Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's a pretty necklace.
Charlie: Thank you.
Ross: Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)
Charlie: Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.
Ross: Oh my God, I love you.
Charlie: Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
Ross: That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Charlie: Your first marriage?
Ross: Yeah.
Charlie: You're married more than once?
Ross: No. (they clink glasses and drink)
Charlie: So, why did you break up?
Ross: (embarassed) Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
Charlie: Oh my God, this is so cool!
Ross: Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Charlie: No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!
Ross: Hey! High-five! (they high-five)
Charlie: Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fianc√© was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
Ross: My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Charlie: Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: ""Oh, I knew all along""
Ross: I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: ""Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay""
Charlie: I know!
Ross: And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
Charlie: I didn't do that.
Ross: (embarassed) Me neither.
[Scene: the Pharmacist convention. Joey and Rachel are walking out of it, drinking cocktails]
Joey: Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
Rachel: I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Joey: Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
Rachel: Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
Joey: But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
Rachel: (takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) No.
Joey: There it is, you're blushing!
Rachel: No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
Joey: You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)
Rachel: No.
Joey: Tell me who it is.
Rachel: Joey! (she walks away; Joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)
Joey: Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
Rachel: Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Joey: What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
Rachel: Oh! (pause) Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
Joey: (eagerly) Yeah, who is that?
Rachel: Do ya?
Joey: Yeah.
(Ross and Charlie walk into the hall from Ross's room)
Ross and Charlie: Hey!
(Joey smiles at them. Rachel looks annoyed)
Charlie: (to Joey) I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
Joey: Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Ross: Yep, we got it, we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much.
Charlie: I had a great time.
Joey: Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
Rachel: Later! La...
Charlie: So, shall we?
Joey: Yeah. (they leave)
Rachel: Ok. See you, bye.
Charlie: Bye.
Ross: Good night.
Joey: Night.
(Ross and Rachel watch them walk away and sigh. They look at each other, embarassed.)
Ross and Rachel: Ok, good night!
[Scene: The restaurant. Chandler and Monica are sitting at a table]
(Phoebe and David walk in)
Monica: I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Chandler: You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
(David and Phoebe sit down at a table close to Chandler and Monica's)
David: Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
Monica: Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
Chandler: I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) ""Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..."" Spit it out, David!
David: Uh, Phoebe, uh... (Chandler hits his own head) you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
Phoebe: Sure, ok, yeah.
David: But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...
(David produces the ring. At the same time, Mike walks in, behind David)
Phoebe: Oh my God, Mike!
David: It's David, actually!
Phoebe: No, Mike's here.
David: (turns around) Hi Mike!
Mike: Hi David. Chandler. Monica... (Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!
Monica: IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Mike: Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe: What are you, what are you doing here?
Mike: I have a question I need to ask you.
David: I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
Mike: Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
David: (annoyed) Ok, would you care for my seat as well?
Mike: Actually yeah, that'll be great.
David: That's fair, you've had a long trip. (he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)
Mike: Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
David: Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
Mike: Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
David: Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
Monica: You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring...
David: I have a ring.
Chandler: I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
David: Phoebe, will you marry me?
Phoebe: (smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!
David: Uhm... Ha ha!
Phoebe: I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
Mike: We can have any future you want.
(they hold their hands, gazing at each other)
David: Ok, I'm gonna take off.
Phoebe: David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
David: Just so I know, if I had asked first...
Phoebe: Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
David: Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! (he leaves)
Mike: Is it ok if I hug you now?
Phoebe: Yes! (they hug)
Monica: (to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's room. Monica and Chandler are in bed.]
Chandler: Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
Monica: I know (she snuggles to him)
(Rachel runs in)
Rachel: (walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Chandler: I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
(Rachel opens the drapes)
Monica: The sun is out!
Chandler: Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Monica: Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Chandler: Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Rachel: Nooo!
Monica: Damn it!
Ross: (from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!
[Scene: Conference room. Ross is making his keynote speech]
Ross: Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Rachel: Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
Ross: Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
Chandler: (to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.
(the paleontologist glares at Chandler)
Ross: And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
(all the paleontologists laugh)
Chandler: (to the one sitting next to him) Really?
Ross: But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
(Joey laughs)
Charlie: What?
Joey: He said ""erectus""!
Charlie: You're... you're kidding, right?
Joey: No, he really said it.
Ross: ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
(Rachel laughs)
Joey: Erectus?
Rachel: Homo.
[Scene: the hotel conference room]
Ross: (concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!
(Everybody stands up and applauds. Ross looks flattered and surprised. His friends and other members of the audience go to congratulate him)
Ross: Oh, thanks guys!
Man with a bow tie: (shaking hands with Ross) I thought... it was wonderful!
Ross: Oh!
Man with a bow tie: Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. (sighs) I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... (sighs again and smiles at Ross blissfully).
Ross: (with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)
Rachel: All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?
Monica: Yeah!
Rachel: (to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!
Ross: Oh, thank you so much!
Joey: Yeah, and so funny!
Rachel: Oh!
(Rachel, Joey and Chandler pat him on his shoulders and walk off, together with Monica)
Ross: (puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
Mike: (popping by, smiling) You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
(Ross is dumbfounded to see Mike instead of David)
Mike: Oh... I'm back!
Ross: (skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Phoebe & Mike: Yeah! (they leave)
(Ross goes towards Charlie, who's conversing with a fellow paleontologist, and touches her shoulder to get her attention)
Ross: Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)
Charlie: You were incredible!
Ross: Yeah?
Charlie: You blew them away!
Ross: Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?
Charlie: (smiling broadly) I was not!
Ross: No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Charlie: Oh my God! (pauses) I'm your groupie!
Ross: (joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
(Ross giggles, but Charlie isn't amused at all.)
Ross: (realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!
[Scene: the hotel lobby. Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Mike walk in from the outside.]
Monica: (her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
(They approach the buffet, where a couple of paleontologists are sipping their drinks)
Phoebe: Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!
(Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Mike walk away, sipping their drinks)
Monica: So, what are we gonna do today?
Mike: They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Monica: (pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
Chandler: I don't think so!
Monica: (disappointed) Why not?
Chandler: Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
Monica: I'm not always that bad!
Chandler: Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
Monica: (hesitatingly) I punched you...?
Chandler: And...?
Monica: ... Phoebe...?
Phoebe: ... and...?
Monica: I clunked your heads together!
(Chandler turns to Mike and gives him a ""See what I mean?"" look)
[Scene: Joey and Charlie's room]
(Joey is sitting in an armchair and wearing a diving mask. He pulls out a grape from a bunch of fake grapes on the coffee table, puts it on the snorkel's breathing tube and blows it out, then giggles to himself)
Charlie: (walking in) Hey! There you are!
Joey: Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)
Charlie: I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
Joey: (disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
Charlie: You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and (pauses) especially last night...
Joey: (interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)
Charlie: Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
Joey: (bewildered) Oh! O",

[Scene: Barbados, Monica and Chandler's Room. They both enter from Ross's
  room. Monica still has her big, frizzy hair.]
Monica: Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such
  a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)
Chandler: You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
Monica: I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
Chandler: You're on!
(they start to get ready, but then Phoebe enters through the door from Ross's
  room)
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: What's up?
Phoebe: Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the
  way there's  no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you
  want...
(there's a door slamming in Ross's room, and some indistinct murmuring)
Ross: ... finally...
Phoebe: Is that Ross?
Monica: Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid
  walls.
Phoebe: Sounds like he's with someone.
Chandler: He could be alone. This morning I heard him do
  push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
Monica: Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I
  hear someone else in there with him.
(they all put their ear against the wall to be able to hear what's
  being said. We move to Ross's room where he and Charlie are kissing.)
Charlie: Ooh... Dr. Geller!
Ross: God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you
  to call me that.
Monica: Oh my God, that's Charlie!
Chandler: She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Phoebe: Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
Monica: I'm not sure about this.
Phoebe: Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
Monica: No I'm not sure that it's  the best way to hear
  everything. Someone get me a glass!
Phoebe: Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop
  on my friend.
Rachel: (through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!  
(Phoebe starts to listen at the other wall, where Rachel's room is. There,
  Joey and Rachel are kissing.)
Joey: Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm
    kissing Rachel!
Rachel: I know, I'm her!
(they start to kiss again, and Phoebe turns to Chandler and Monica)
Phoebe: (whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Get over here!
(Chandler and Monica take a sprint to the other wall)
Rachel: ooh...
Chandler: Wow!
Monica: (in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God,
  I love how thin these walls are!
(In the rooms next door, Joey, Rachel, Ross and Charlie stop kissing and try
  to understand what the yelling was about. After a while they continue kissing.
  We're back in Chandler and Monica's room. Monica has some of her own hair
  stuffed in her mouth by Chandler.)
Monica: (muffled) Thank you.
OPENING CREDITS
(Rachel and Joey's)
Rachel: Hey, you know, before you said
    that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
Joey: Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then
  I saw him kissing Charlie...
Rachel: What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really
  making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
(Chandler and Monica's)
Monica: I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
Chandler: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?
  No-one is manning that wall!
Monica: I'm on it!
Chandler: Anything?
Monica: I think I hear curtains closing... 
Phoebe: We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
Monica: Bedsprings, unmistakable!
Chandler: You do realise  that's your brother?
Monica: Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler
  makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall.
  Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey
  and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people  leaving with the
  same person we came with.
Chandler: That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving
  with Weird Al.
Monica: Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning,
  before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
Chandler: Okay Buckwheat!
Phoebe: You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free
  porn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)
(Ross and Charlie's)
Ross: Weh...*sigh*
Charlie: uhm... Is everything okay?
Ross: Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
Charlie: Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread,
  because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could
  just...
Ross: No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where
  they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up.
  Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
Charlie: I uhm... I completely understand.
Ross: Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit,
  looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing
  up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries
  to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later.
Charlie: Okay...
(Chandler and Monica's, all three of them are listening at the wall to
  Ross and Charlie's)
Phoebe: That's the door. He's gone...
Chandler: And she's... turning on the TV... and watching...
  Miss Congeniality!
Monica: Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it
  too well!
(They are still listening at the wall, when Ross enters their room)
Ross: Hey, what are you guys doing?
Phoebe: Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying
  goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort
  and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)
Monica: (also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank
  you! (walks to Phoebe)
Chandler: (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!
Ross: Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
Chandler: He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend
  Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)
Ross: Well, if you see him could you please tell
  him I'm looking for him?
Chandler: You got it!
Ross: Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the
  wall) Thank you! (closes the door)
Monica: Other wall, people! Other wall!
(they rush to the wall to Rachel and Joey's, and we move to that room)
Ross: (knocks on door) Rach,  you there? (Joey and Rachel
  both get up from the bed)
Joey: Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
Rachel: Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he
  knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like
  stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking
  up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!
Joey: No idea what it means.
Rachel: Oh... okay, just hide!
Ross: (knocks) Rach?
Rachel: Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
(When Rachel
    starts to look under the bed if Joey would fit under there, Chandler opens
  the door inbetween the rooms, grabs Joey by his shirt and drags him to his
   room, and closes the door again)
Rachel: There's no room under the bed. (looks around because
  she can't find Joey anymore)
Ross: Is everything okay?
Rachel: Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and
  opens the door)
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Hi...
Ross: You know where Joey is?
Rachel: ...I really don't... (looks around again)
Ross: Can I talk to you for a minute?
Rachel: Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if
  Joey is there)
(Monica and Chandler's room. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler have their ears pressed
  against the wall, and Joey looks at them)
Joey: I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Phoebe: Shhh... This is the listening side of the
  wall.
(Now Joey also wants to listen, and wants to press his ears against the door,
  which has a big mirror on it, he hesitates seeing himself in the mirror, but
  still puts his ear against it. We move again to Rachel's room.)
Ross: And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up,
  and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
Rachel: (clearly not listening and still trying to find out
  where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...
Ross: And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the
  day I met her.
Rachel: (still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been
  really hard for you.
Ross: Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before
  you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna
  be?
Rachel: (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say,
  Ross. That is hard to say.
Ross: You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
Rachel: You would think!
(Ross leaves the room)
Rachel: Joey!
Joey: Is he gone?
Rachel: (still can't find him) How are you doing this?
(Joey now enters the room through the door, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe are
  following him.)
Joey: Pssst...
Rachel: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this?
  Have you guys been listening this entire time?
Monica, Chandler and Phoebe: YE-AH!
Phoebe: Now, what is this?
Rachel: Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten
  minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth
  grade!
Phoebe: Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated
  this could get? What about Ross?
Joey: Well, he's with Charlie now.
Monica: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything
  really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think
  he deserves the same from you?
Joey: (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in
  my ass, Geller!
Rachel: All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all
  the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
Chandler: Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you
  do one thing for us? The people that  care about you?
Rachel: Sure...
Chandler: Enunciate!
Rachel: Get out!
(They leave and Rachel locks the door.)
Rachel: Are they right?
Joey: Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off
  until we talk to Ross.
Rachel: Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have
  to do anything tonight.
Joey: Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna...
  I'm gonna take off...
Rachel: (Joey walks to the door) Although... 
Joey: (turns around very fast) I like although!
Rachel: I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like...
  six years...
Joey: Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Rachel: Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
Joey: Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
Rachel: No...
Joey: I'm thinking about you...
Rachel: Yeah...
Joey: Let's forget about Ross...
Rachel: Forgotten.
(They want to kiss, but just before their lips touch, Rachel pulls back quickly,
  gasping)
Joey: What's wrong?
Rachel: Nothing...
Joey's voice, but she sees Ross: Seriously... What is it?
Rachel: Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here,
  come here...
(again, just before their lips touch, she pulls back, gasping)
Joey's voice/Ross: What's wrong?
Rachel: Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out
  of my head...
Joey: Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately,
  closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late,
  and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)
Rachel/Ross: Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do
  that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head
  away again...)
Joey: Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Both: Yeah
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's room. Chandler is packing when Ross knocks on
  the door and enters...]
Ross: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: You guys ready to go?
Chandler: Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm
  just finishing packing.
Ross: Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
Chandler: You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's
  a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
Ross: Learn about Jesus...
(Charlie now also enters the room, Chandler walks to the bathroom)
Ross: Hey!
Charlie: So, did you talk to Joey?
Ross: Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk
  to him on the plane.
Charlie: Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
Ross: Stop it!
Charlie: PHD
Ross: You're filthy!
(Phoebe enters)
Phoebe: Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
Ross: Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
Phoebe: Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
(Monica enters, with her hair braided and little shells at the end)
Monica: Check it out!
Phoebe: Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
(Chandler enters from the bathroom)
Chandler: Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
Monica: What do you think?
Chandler: I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Monica: Don't you just love it?
Ross: Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
Charlie: It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
Ross: You've never said that in your life, have you?
Charlie: Not once.
Ross: I thought so.
Monica: And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells
  tingle)
Chandler: What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the
  ears.
[Scene: Boarding the plane.]
Joey: Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting
  next to Charlie after we broke up.
Chandler: Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care
  about your social life.
Joey: Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
Ross: Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference
  with Charlie.
Joey: I understand...
Ross: No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass
  and gives Joey his one.)
Chandler: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't
  wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
(Switch to Phoebe and Mike, who are kissing)
Phoebe: Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain
  turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
Mike: You should be careful when checking your overhead bins,
  'cause items may shift during...
Phoebe: Aaah... you're not good at this...
Mike: You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
Phoebe: No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
Mike: Oh...
Phoebe: What?
Mike: Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
Phoebe: Why not?
Mike: I have a date.
Phoebe: You have a... You have a date? With who?
Mike: Oh, it's... my girlfriend.
Phoebe: (lets go of his hand) You have...  have a girlfriend?
Mike: Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started
  seeing someone.
Phoebe: For how long?
Mike: Three months.
Phoebe: Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my
  business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
Mike: I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I
  promise.
Phoebe: Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you
  get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
Mike: Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the
  packing material...
Phoebe: You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave
  it there.
(cut to Charlie and Ross)
Ross: Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the
  right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty
  free"".
Charlie: Okay... Good luck.
(Ross gets up and gestures to Rachel, we cut to Joey and Rachel)
Rachel: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really
  good time to talk to him.
Joey: I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Rachel: Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done,
  they'll probably be serving dinner.
Joey: Ooh...
Rachel: Still nervous?
Joey: I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Ross: Hey Rach...
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Rachel: Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths ""Good luck"" to
  Joey and gets up from her seat)
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Joey: Yeah?
Ross: Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry
  to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...,
  well...
Joey: You kissed.
Ross: Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?
Joey: I saw you.
Ross: Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else
  happened, okay.
Joey: Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
Ross: What?
Joey: It's okay. You know, I totally understand,
  alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And...
  I want you to be happy.
Ross: Are you serious?
Joey: Yeah... Now I have something...
Ross: I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put
  my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know
  that?
Joey: Oh... uh...  look... before you...
Ross: No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless,
  and generous...
Joey: I am those things, yeah.
Ross: You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always
  think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some
  stuff...
Joey: Dude!
Ross: Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Joey: I can't think of anything.
(They both hug, and Rachel, who was in the back of the plane, sees this and
  smiles.)
Ross: Thanks!
Joey: Yeah.
(Ross walks to the back of the plane, where Rachel is.)
Rachel: So hi!
Ross: Hi!
Rachel: So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Ross: Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
Rachel: Oh! That's great!
Ross: Yeah!
Rachel: Oh, so everything's okay?
Ross: Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing
  guy.
Rachel: Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
Ross: Well, I'm so excited about this.
Rachel: Really? Excited?
Ross: Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams
  about this...
Rachel: Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still
  looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and
  hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?
Joey: I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things
  about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge
  on Chandler.
Rachel: Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget
  it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
Joey: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
(Chandler walks by and Joey lets out an evil ""muhahaho"".)
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Mike's apartment. Phoebe's there and the phone rings.]
Phoebe: Hi, Mike's place.
Mike: Hey, it's Mike.
Phoebe: Ooh, that was fast.
Mike: Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think
  I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
Phoebe: Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap
  on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know,
  women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while.
  Just F.Y.I.
Mike: One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious
  on my coffee table.
Phoebe: Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you
  pick her up at the pound?
Mike: Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up. 
Phoebe: Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch
  her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)
(there's knocking on the door which Phoebe opens)
Precious: Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
Phoebe: (stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.
Precious: Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of
  his life? That Phoebe?
Phoebe: Enchant√© (she holds out her hand, and they shake
  hands)
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's carrying the laundry hamper
  to their coffee table.]
Monica: Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...
  (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!
Chandler: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
Monica: Yeah!
Chandler: So if you want people to see them, then by definition
  you're not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
Monica: Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be
  able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her
  hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she
  brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)
Chandler: What are you singing?
Monica: It's ""Bolero"" from ""10"".
Chandler: It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse
  Now""...
  See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy
  hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore,
  so if you think about it... I hate them!
Monica: You what? You said you liked them.
Chandler: Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was
  that I could see your scalp.
Monica: Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
Chandler: Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel
  said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey...
  Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
Monica: You know what? I don't care. I like it like this,
  and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...
  (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!
Chandler: Hit yourself in the tooth?
Monica: And the eye!
[Scene: Ross's apartment.Someone's knocking on the door. Ross rushes to the
  door and it's Rachel with Emma.]
Ross: (gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed
  you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have
  a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants
  again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)
Rachel: That was one time, Ross, and they were only like
  5 milligrams.
Ross: Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?
  Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
Rachel: Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really
  need to talk to you about.
Ross: (unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!
Rachel: Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
Ross: (gasps) OH NO!
Rachel: What? What is it?
Ross: Oh, major shampoo explosion!
Rachel: Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Ross: Oh, it's all over everything. Why?
  Why me? (looks up)
Rachel: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Ross: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
Rachel: Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Ross: Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser.
  It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
Rachel: Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Ross: Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)
[Scene: Mike's place. Phoebe is on the phone.]
Phoebe: Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See,
  you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at
  the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong.
  Point is... I'm gonna take off.
Precious: I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's
  going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
Phoebe: Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?
Precious: My name is Precious.
Phoebe: Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be
  straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately
  that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about
  that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
Precious: I just can't believe this... Why?
Phoebe: Well, I don't...
Precious: Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong
  with me?
Phoebe: Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
Precious: I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
Phoebe: Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have
    some pride, for the love of God.
(Precious starts crying)
Phoebe: Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
Precious: I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any
  warning.
Phoebe: But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning
  on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
Precious: He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday  ever.
  (she starts to cry again)
Phoebe: Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this.
  You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a
  wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna
  break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell,
  but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
Precious: Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need
  him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
(Mike enters the apartment.)
Precious: Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard,
  and I hope you rot in hell. 
(she slaps him in the face, Mike looks like he
    doesn't believe what just happened. Precious leaves, and he turns to Phoebe.)
Phoebe: You're welcome!
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's. Only Chandler is in the living room and walks
  to the bathroom.]
Chandler: Honey, you've been in there for a long time...
  Is everything okay?
Monica: Not really. 
(Chandler enters the bathroom, and Monica is standing there in a towel, with
  her hair stuck in the shower curtain.)
Monica: I have a problem.
Chandler: Really? What happened?
Monica: Well, I was dancing around, and singing ""No Woman,
  No Cry"" and I got stuck.
Chandler: You can't move at all?
Monica: Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth
  the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair
  as she goes)
Chandler: If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the
corn rose?
Monica: (looking disappointed) I guess so...
Chandler: (trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little
  frayed.
Monica: Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Joey enters.]
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Joey: So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
Rachel: Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related
  emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
Joey: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better
  if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if
  he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he
  pushes  his breasts together from the side)
Rachel: Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
Joey: Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how
  about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
Rachel: Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again
  we can't...
Joey: I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can
  control ourselves, we're not animals.
Rachel: No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that
  means good night then?
Joey: Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss
  on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)
Rachel: Goo--ood night!
Joey: Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but
  this time it lasts longer)
Rachel: Seriously, good night!
Joey: Stop saying good night.
Rachel: Okay.
(Now they kiss passionately... and then Ross enters with Emma. They freeze,
  pull away and look at Ross who looks like he just can't believe what he's seeing.
  Joey straightens his shirt, and Rachel says I'm so-oo sorry, and
  presses her breasts together, just like Joey did before.)
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Monica walks in with one of those knitted Rasta
  hats.]
Monica: Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks
  up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...
Chandler: Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a
  little something for me?
Monica: Sure, what do you have in mind?
Chandler: I think you know.
Monica: Really? I don't really feel like it.
Chandler: This is what I want to do.
Monica: Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
Chandler: (Picks up the ""Miss Congeniality"" DVD) She's an
  FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.

1002 - The One Where Ross Is Fine

Written by: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Plummer
  Directed by: Ben Weiss
  Transcribed by: Kreidy

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. The scene starts where we took off in
the last episode with Ross seeing Joey and Rachel kissing. Rosss tares at them.]
Joey: Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see  that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
Rachel: We weren't doing anything!
Joey: Rach, he just saw us.
Rachel: Shhh.
Joey: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
Rachel: No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Joey (to Rachel): Dude, chill! (to Ross) Okay, we also kissed in  Barbados,
but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because
I saw you kissing Charlie.
Rachel: Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
Joey: Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it  ever happened, but..
Rachel: We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Joey: Yeah, but it did happen, so...
(Ross looks shocked and says nothing.)
Joey: Ross?
Rachel: Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?

OPENING CREDITS

  [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Continued from earlier.]
Rachel: Ross, say something. Anything.
Ross: So you two are..?
Joey and Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: And have you .. ed?
Joey: No, no, no!
Rachel: No, no, no!
Ross: But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
Joey: Probably.
(Rachel looks at him.)
Joey: No, no!
Rachel: Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.  You have every right to go nuts.
Ross: I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Rachel: No, but you know what I mean.
Ross: Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  (Squeaky.) I'm fine!
Joey: Really?
Ross: Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know  why
  it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice)  I'm fine.
  I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys  kissing. I mean,
at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin'
this.
Joey: Ross..
Ross: It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what
  we should do?
Rachel: Calm ourselves?
Ross: No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
  I'll cook!!
Joey: Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
Ross: Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if
  someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms
  off.)
Joey: I do like fajitas.

  [Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Chandler are there. They have lots of
  brochures about adoption in front of them.]
Monica: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's
  inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways
  to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
Chandler: There's a hair in my coffee.
(Phoebe enters.)
Phoebe: Hey guys!
Monica: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with
  the triplets.
Chandler: You know, it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets,"" I
  immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
(Monica glares at him.)
Monica: That's sweet. Drink your hair.
Phoebe: Hey, what's all this stuff?
Monica: Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
Phoebe: Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
Monica: That's not really how it works.
Phoebe: Oh, how does it work?
Monica: I don't know!
Phoebe: Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my
  friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help
  you.
Monica: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be
  great?
(Chandler looks like he did the time he swallowed the toy in 605 TOW
  Joey's Porsche. It's the hair in his coffee.)
(Frank Jr. and the triplets enter.)
Frank Jr.: Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about.
  When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
(The triplets scream and run amok in the coffeehouse.)
Frank Jr.: That's not what we talked about!!
Phoebe: Hey!
Frank Jr.: Hey.
Phoebe: Good to see you.
Frank Jr.: Good to see you, too.
Monica: Hi Frank.
Frank Jr.: Hi, how you doin'?
Monica: Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
(Little Chandler is pulling Chandler's sweater, while Leslie is
  throwing bagels at him.)
Monica: Which one is which again?
Frank Jr.: Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the
  lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's
  Leslie throwing bagels at him.
Monica (reads a form in her lap): ""Willing to adopt triplets?"" No!

  [Scene: The hallway in Ross's building. Joey and Rachel are on their
  way to Ross's dinner.]
Joey: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's
  cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our
  first date.
Rachel: Well, what would we be doing?
Joey: I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy
  dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
Rachel: Feel me up?
Joey: In a carriage!
(Charlie walks up to them.)
Joey: Hey, Charlie!
Rachel: Hey.
Charlie: Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
Rachel: Oh, you bet.
(Joey sees that she's carrying a small red bag.)
Joey: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
Charlie: Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
Joey: Oh. Oh, thanks.
Charlie: And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you
  want.
Joey: Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
(They enter Ross's apartment. Ross is already quite hyper.)
Ross: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey.
  (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new
  girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He
  squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.
Rachel: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
Ross: Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what
  did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)
Joey: Uh, actually, that's..
Ross: Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these
  things!!
Charlie: Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
Ross: What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you?
  You see? Who else is fine?
Joey: Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe
  have a drink.
Ross: You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a
  pitcher of Margaritas.
(Does a Mexican dancing-thing before going to the kitchen.)

  [Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there.
  The triplets are now sleeping on top of each other on the couch.]
Phoebe: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
Frank Jr.: Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you
  know it, they're gonna be awake again.
Phoebe: Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
Frank Jr.: Yeah.
Phoebe: Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest
  thing..
Frank Jr.: I haven't slept in four years!
Phoebe: That's a, that's a long time.
Frank Jr.: You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so
  many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold
  one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with
  his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's
  three of them, Phoebe, three!
Phoebe: Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out
  of my area.
Frank Jr.: Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it,
  it's too horrible. No.
Phoebe: What?
Frank Jr.: No, I can't.
Phoebe: Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I
  didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
Frank Jr.: Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking
  that, you know, maybe you could take one.
Phoebe: What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?

  [Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler and Monica enter.]
Monica: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great
  things about you guys.
Colleen: Oh, please, we're happy to help.
Bill: We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
Chandler: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this
  room, huh?
(Bill and Colleen look shocked.)
Chandler: I mean, you have a lovely home.
Monica: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Colleen: Well, actually, I think this might help.
(She gives Monica a big binder that's perfectly in order.)
Colleen: It's pretty much all the information you need.
Monica: Oh my god!
Colleen: Everything is broken down into categories, and then
  cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms
  in the back.
Monica: Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
Bill: I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.
  Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
Chandler: That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
(Monica looks at him.)
Chandler: You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Monica: It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Colleen: The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
(Chandler leaves.)
Colleen: I would have told him to do it too.
Monica: Can I adopt you?
(Cut to the hall. Owen is wearing his scout-uniform and is looking
  through a box when Chandler walks up to him.)
Chandler: Hey, you must be Owen.
Owen: Yeah.
Chandler: I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Owen: You were?
Chandler: Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
Owen: Huh?
Chandler: You know how to use a compass?
Owen: I have a badge in it.
Chandler: You do? That's fantastic!
Owen: You wanna see it?
Chandler: I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your
  parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
Owen: What?!?
Chandler: What?
Owen: I'm adopted?
(Chandler tries to come up with a good answer.)
Chandler: I got nothing.

  [Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is totally wasted, but he's still
  drinking all the margaritas.]
Ross: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second
  batch is gooooood.
Rachel: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
Ross: Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us.
  Just hangin'.
Joey: Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
Ross: I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us.
  There's no weirdness, no tension.
Rachel: No awareness.
Ross: We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh!
  Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
(The oven timer pings in the kitchen.)
Ross: My fajitas!!
(He runs off to the kitchen.)
Rachel: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a
  little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he
  normally doesn't drink like this.
Charlie: Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging
  alcoholic.
(Joey and Rachel don't know how to respond to that.)
Charlie: Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
(Ross enters carrying a frying pan with fajitas - without any oven
  mitts.)
Ross: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Rachel: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
(Ross laughs.)
Ross: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!

  [Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there.
  Continued from earlier.]
Phoebe: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me
  taking one of your kids, can we?
Frank Jr.: No, of course we're not.
Phoebe: Insane.
Frank Jr.: I know.
Phoebe: Alice would never go for it, right?
Frank Jr.: Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've
  got her onboard.
Phoebe: Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know,
  hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
Frank Jr.: Huh.
Phoebe: Frank Jr.Jr.?
Frank Jr.: Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know,
  he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Frank Jr.: What's green and says ""hey, I'm a frog""? A talking frog!
  (Laughs.) Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
Phoebe: Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
Frank Jr.: Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that
  knows how to burp the alphabet.
Phoebe: Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
Frank Jr.: Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my
  little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a
  realtor..
Phoebe: Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
Frank Jr.: Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I
  can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but
  they're my babies.
Phoebe: I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You
  know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You
  name the day, and I'll be there.
Frank Jr.: How about tomorrow?
Phoebe: Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff
  around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day
  together.
Frank Jr.: You'd do that for us?
Phoebe: Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
Frank Jr. (looks at the triplets): Look at them! Aw. I love you so
  much. (Strokes Leslie's hair, and she moves a little.) Oh crap, don't
  wake up, don't wake up!

  [Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler comes running into the
  living room. Monica is the only one there.]
Chandler: Where are Bill and Colleen?
Monica: They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you
  believe how nice they are?
Chandler: We have to leave!!
Monica: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
Chandler: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way,
  and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may
  have told him.
Monica: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace
  everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
(Bill and Colleen enter.)
Colleen: Hey.
Bill: Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the
  sour worms. Those are for Owen.
Colleen: I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we
  haven't told him he's adopted yet.
Chandler: But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he
  already knows?
(Owen comes running in.)
Owen: I'm adopted?!
Chandler: See? Intuitive!
Bill: What? Where did you hear that?
Owen: He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
Chandler: Which technically now you should give back!
Colleen: You told him he's adopted?
Chandler: I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or
  something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the
  door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa
  is real.""
Owen: He isn't?!
Chandler (to Monica): We have to get out of here, baby!

  [Scene: Ross's apartment. Rachel, Joey and Charlie are eating fajitas
  when Ross enters from the kitchen.]
Ross: Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
Rachel: Ooy.
Ross: And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is
  life without love?
Rachel: Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
Ross: O is for ""oh, wow!"" The V is for this very surprising turn
  of
  events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely
  normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might
  get married and have children of your own.
(Ross chokes up and pauses. Rachel and Joey look at him.)
Joey: Dude, are you okay?
Ross: Totally.
Rachel: Ross, you don't seem okay.
Ross (on the verge of tears): I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of
  entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
Charlie: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
Ross: No!
Charlie: I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but
  this has been lovely.
Ross: Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and
  that you never really liked Rachel.
Charlie: You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
Ross: Okay.
Charlie: Alright.
(Ross goes to the kitchen.)
Charlie: God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..
Rachel: Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
Charlie: Bye.
(Ross enters from the kitchen with three plates with flan.)
Ross: Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
Rachel: You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Ross: Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple
  now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
Rachel: No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
Ross: Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of
  margaritas. It's all good.
(The oven timer pings again.)
Ross: I don't even know what that's for.
(He goes back to the kitchen.)
Joey: You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's
  okay.
Rachel: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Joey: Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
Rachel: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever
  gonna be okay with this.
Joey: It doesn't look good, does it?
(They kiss each other on the cheek, and Rachel leaves.)

  [Scene: Ross's apartment the next morning. Ross is very hung-over on
  the couch as Joey enters with a cup of coffee for him.]
Joey: Morning. Here you go.
Ross: Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Joey: Yeah.
Ross: So you took off my pants and shoes?
Joey: No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the
  Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you
  don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
Ross: What do you mean?
Joey: Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do
  anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
Ross: Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
Joey: It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're
  not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
Ross: Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six
  years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
Joey: That's what I hear, yeah.
Ross: This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys
  aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is
  this thing with you and Rachel?
Joey: Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
Ross: Joey.
Joey: I'm crazy about her.
Ross: And she feels the same way?
Joey: I think so.
Ross: Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
Joey: Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
Ross: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie,
  right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't
  see the dance, did she?
Joey: No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure
  about this?
Ross: Yeah, I'm sure.
Joey: And we're okay?
(Ross smiles and holds up his hand for a high-five, but he has
  forgotten about his burnt hands. He gasps in pain as Joey grabs his
  hand.)

ENDING CREDITS

  [Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Chandler enter to find Phoebe there
  with the triplets.]
Monica: Hey, Phoebs
Phoebe: Hey.
Monica: Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate
  us.
Chandler: Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Still, he had to find out sometime.
Chandler: Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets
  that you gave birth to them?
(The triplets stare at him.)
Chandler: I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)

  this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda
  using an awful British accent) ""Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!""
Chandler: Are you trying to do a British accent?
Monica: (pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets
  pedicures!
Chandler: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Phoebe: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on
  the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) ""Oh, so sorry to catch you
  on your Mo-Bile!"" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call
  me on my mo-Bile!""
Monica: I know, and she's always bragging
  about all the famous people she's met.
Phoebe: Oh, I know! ""Oh...I slept with Billy Joel"".
  All right, who hasn't?
Monica: Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't
  wanna see her!!
Phoebe: Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and
  dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Monica: Oh, I guess we could try that, but...
  it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?
Chandler: No, had it done to me though. Feels good !

[Scene: At the tanning salon. Ross and a male assistant are
  walking through a hall]
Assistant: Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way!
So, how dark do you wanna be? We
have one, two or three.
Ross: Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Assistant: Puerto Rican.
Ross: Two, I think a two.
Assistant: You've got to face the red light.
  When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes.
  When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks
  then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?
Ross: Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
Assistant: Wow, you catch on quick.
Ross: Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not
  impressed by this statement)
  (Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. He stands up
  in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)
Ross: One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer
  starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've
  not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)
Ross: You sprayed my front twice!
Assistant: You've never turned?

Ross: No, I barely even
  got to three Mississippi. 
Assistant: Mississippi? I said count to
  five'!
Ross: Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how
  bad is it?
Assistant: Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps
  getting darker for the next four hours.
Ross: So, how dark is it
  gonna get?
Assistant: You got sprayed with two two'
  s and...
Ross: I'm a four?
Assistant: Yeah, but you're back's a zero.
  You're gonna wanna even that out.
Ross: (sarcastically) Really!
Assistant: You might wanna get back in there.
Ross: (annoyed) Ok!
(The assistant leaves and Ross goes back in the spray-on tan booth and turns
  his back to the spray nozzles, facing the back wall)
Ross: Wait, wait a minute, there's no light
  on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns
  and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns
  again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out
  of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing
  happened again!
Assistant: You got two more twos?
Ross: (hysterically) I'm an eight!
[Scene: Joey‚Äôs apartment. Joey and Rachel enter the room]
Rachel: Thanks for dinner.
Joey: I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems
  puzzled) Ha, guess we won‚Äôt be going back there!
Rachel: So.
Joey: Yeah.
(Joey and Rachel start kissing)
Joey: Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of
  the couch?
Rachel: I say ‚Äòcheesy line‚Äô, but ok.
(They move on the couch and start kissing again. Joey does his grazing on
  Rachel‚Äôs thigh and she slaps his hand)
Joey: What‚Äôs the matter?
Rachel: I am sorry, I don‚Äôt know, I am sorry, I don‚Äôt
  know why I did that!
Joey and Rachel: Okay
Rachel: Ok, so sorry.
(They start kissing again and, when Joey grazes her thigh, she slaps him on
  his hand again)
Rachel: I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don‚Äôt
  know what happened, I must be nervous!
Joey: I don‚Äôt get it, Chandler loved it!
Rachel: Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won‚Äôt
  do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
Joey: Ok.
(They start kissing again and when Joey grazes, she slaps him three times,
  on the hand, and on both cheeks)
Joey: (a little giddy) Uh, was that good for you?
[Scene: Monica‚Äôs apartment. Monica and Phoebe are reading
  magazines when the phone rings and Phoebe reaches to pick it up]
Monica: (to Phoebe) No, no, don‚Äôt get it. Let the machine
pick up.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could
  baby-sit again.
Monica: It could be Amanda!
Phoebe: Oh, you‚Äôre right! I was just kidding about
  Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
(The machine picks up the phone)
Amanda: Hello Monica. It‚Äôs Amanda calling again. I
  am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!
Monica: You're from Yonkers! Your last name
  is Buffo-Martisis!
Amanda: Let‚Äôs see.. to assure you get this directly,
  ring me back on my mobile.
Phoebe: Ok, don‚Äôt hold thy breath!
(Sound of dialing numbers is heard from the speaker of the machine)
Chandler: Hello? Is someone on the line?
Amanda: Yes, I was looking for Monica.
Chandler: Hang on, she‚Äôs right here. (he enters the
  living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.
Monica: We weren‚Äôt picking up, it‚Äôs
  Amanda!
Chandler: (to Amanda) I get pedicures!
Monica: Hi Amanda! Actually now... it‚Äôs...
  is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe
  and I will see you then!
Phoebe: Why, why, why didn‚Äôt you just say no!
Monica: Well, I said 'no' to her coming
  over now! I couldn‚Äôt say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to
  please people!
Phoebe: (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well
  under torture!
Monica: And you would?
Phoebe: I did!
[scene: Joey‚Äôs apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting
  on the couch]
Joey: Rach, you sure you wanna do this?
Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it‚Äôs just a
  little weird, it‚Äôs you, and it‚Äôs me, it's just gonna take some
  getting used to.
Joey: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
Rachel: Ok, let‚Äôs work from the top down! (Joey nods,
  but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!
Joey: Ok, yeah, got it.
Rachel and Joey: Okay.
(They start kissing and Joey starts to undo her bra, but fails completely)
Joey: This thing welded shut?!
Rachel: Okay.
Joey: All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this
  thing.
Rachel: Oh!
(Joey starts trying to undo her bra, but it won‚Äôt go.The elastic band
  snaps back, hurting Rachel.)
Rachel: Ow!
Joey: Sorry!
Rachel: Well this is romantic!
Joey: I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me
  before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can
  do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!
  I blame your bra!
Rachel: It‚Äôs a standard issue bra clasp!
Joey: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me
  off with all your slapping!
Rachel: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,
  but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take
  off my bra?
Joey: (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said)
  NAH! I don't have another level!! 
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]
(Chandler is at the table reading; Monica puts some food for him on the table.
Ross walks in looking very tanned. Chandler and Monica look up at him
smiling.)

Chandler: Hold on! There is something different.
Ross: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Chandler: Was that place... The Sun?
Ross: Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler
  and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,
  where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
Chandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory
  all by yourself!
Monica: How could you mess this up? It's
  so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Ross: (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?
Monica: One Two Three...
Ross: (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel
  just enters, sees him and starts laughing)
Rachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!
Ross: (Still yelling) I Know!
Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Chandler: How was your date with Joey?
Rachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,
  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and
  I kept slapping it away!
Chandler: You didn't like that?
Rachel: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out
  too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Monica: Wow, really? One time he just looked
  at my bra and it popped open.
(Chandler starts looking at her bra)
Rachel: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have
  kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere
  and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Monica: Well, you guys have been friends
  forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?
  You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true,
  we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna
  power through!
(Joey walks in)
Joey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points
  to the hall).
Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through
  (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).
(Chandler resumes staring at Monica's bra)
Monica: (sees what he is doing) Chandler,
  stop! It is not going to pop open!
Chandler: (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't
  know! (Monica just smiles)
[Scene: Central Perk.]
(Phoebe is sitting on the couch. Monica walks in.)
Monica: Hey Phoebe!
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Is Amanda here yet?
Phoebe: No.
Monica: (sits down) Oh good. Good, look
  I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.
  Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Phoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both
  out of here?
Monica: Well, what do you think of Mike
  and Chandler being in a car accident?
Phoebe: (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!
(A blonde woman walks in. Supposedly Amanda)
Phoebe: Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Amanda: Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug)
Amanda: (To Monica) Hello!
(Monica holds her hands out for a hug, but instead of hugging her, Amanda
  hangs her purse on one of Monica's extended arms.)
Amanda: (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you!
  Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as
  well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch
  my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places
  them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to
  sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
Monica: (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is
  Chandler and...
Amanda: (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's
  not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!
(Monica looks shocked)
Phoebe: Musty!
Amanda: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like
  old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
Monica: When were we not friends?
Amanda: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was
  the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).
Monica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
Amanda: (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging
  her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her. 
Monica: (To Phoebe) You were going to cut
  me out?
Phoebe: Well...kinda.
Monica: Oh My God!
Amanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like
  a perfect arse!
Phoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an ""ass"".
(Monica's mobile starts ringing. She picks it up.)
Monica: (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler,
  what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more)
  Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry,
  but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)
Phoebe: (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my
  God. Was Mike with him?
Monica: Nope! (She turns and leaves)
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]
(Joey comes running in.)
Joey: (To Rachel) Hey!
Rachel: Hey! Got champagne?
Joey: Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
Rachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone
  is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove
  her bra from under her clothes)...
Joey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him) 
Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very
  sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright!
  Lets do it!
Joey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She
  pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like
  that huh?
Joey: Oh! yeah!
Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively,
  putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She
  pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between
  his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)
Joey: uh uh!
Rachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
Joey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
Rachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
Joey: (He just sits there, legs very close together with
  a painful look on his face) Soldier down!
[Monica and Chandlers apartment.]
(Chandler is sitting on the couch reading. Monica walks in.)
Monica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Chandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
(Phoebe and Amanda walk in)
Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can
  I talk to you outside for a minute?
Monica: I have nothing to say to
  you.
Amanda: (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow,
  my flat is twice this size!
Phoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall?
(They both walk to the door and enter the hallway.)
Amanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look
  positively ghastly.
Chandler: Well, aren't you a treat.
[Scene: The hallway]
Monica: I can't believe you tried to cut
  me out. Why Phoebe, why?
Phoebe: It was right after we were living together and you
  were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and
  shrill.
Monica: I'm still all those things!
Phoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
Monica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy.
Phoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't
  keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only
  one who ever clawed her way back in.
Monica: It's because I'm scrappy.
Phoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your
  way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
Monica: I won't know what I would do without
  you.
(They hug)
Monica: Well, I guess we should go back
  in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right.
(They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is ""dancing"" for
  Chandler, but she's really terrible at it)
Amanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional
  dance training.
(Monica and Phoebe look at each other and leave the apartment again)
[Scene: A different spray-on tan center]
(Glenda, who works here, and Ross are walking to the room with the spray-on tan
booth.)
Glenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the
  booth, and...
Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does
  it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them
  all on my back.
Glenda: (quietly) Okay...
(Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands
  with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles
  at both sides of the wall)
Ross: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one
  is it?
(He turns around frantically from side to side.)
Ross: Which... which... which... Which one is it?
(He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in
  this face and front again.)
Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH!
(He now turns to the other side, which also starts spraying his face and front.)
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's]
(Joey and Rachel are both sitting on the couch. Joey keeping his knees pressed
against each other)
Rachel: What is the matter with us?
Joey: Well, I know what's the matter with me.
Rachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed
  to be this... difficult?
Joey: I don't know.
(Chandler enters the apartment)
Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she
  sure can dance... Hey!
Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When
  you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more
  than that?
Chandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide
  from you guys...
Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it
  was... really wrong?
Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt
  like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
(Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get
  to them)
Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the
  good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the
  joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them
  doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's
  difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Rachel: Right, totally.
Joey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...
  do it.
Rachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one
  of those couples that never have sex.
Joey: That's a... pla-an.
(They both stare for a while, and then look at each other)
Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.
Rachel: I know.

Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what
  I wanted. 
Rachel: Hmmm... Me too...
(She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.)
Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Joey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
(Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder)
Rachel: Aah... I bet you're right.
(They look at each other for a while)
Joey: So...
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: I love ya.
Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Joey: Yeah, me too.
(Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.)
Joey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
(Joey takes the ice-bucket with the champagne bottle in it and puts it on
  his sore spot)

ENDING CREDITS 
[Scene: Ross's apartment.]
(Ross is reading a National Geographic on his sofa when Chandler knocks on the
door.)
Chandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
(Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.)
Ross: Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Chandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same
  thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
Ross: Really? Did you count Mississipily?
(Ross walks to the door and opens it.)
Ross: Dude, you're not tanned.
Chandler: No, I just had to get a picture of this.
(Chandler holds up a camera and takes Ross's picture.)
Chandler: I see you later!
(Ross closes the door)

[Scene: Central Perk]
Monica: (she enters) Hey guys!
Ross, Rachel and Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Monica: That place in Vermont? You can  take
  a hint!
Rachel: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
Ross: Yeah!
Rachel: We're having a party.
Monica: Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
Ross: No.
Rachel: No, 
  that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Chandler: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday 
  was!
Ross: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Monica: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. 
  You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
Chandler: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Rachel: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Ross: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing 
  weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Rachel: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can 
  we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
Monica: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Chandler: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this 
  party...
Monica: Believe me, that is not why we won't 
  be doing that!


OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment]
Rachel: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would 
  hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure 
  map to help me find 'em all.
Phoebe: Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... 
  when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood 
  to buy us food!
Ross: (he enters) Hey guys!
Rachel and Phoebe: Hi!
Ross: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Rachel: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma 
  and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
Phoebe: Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
Ross: Yeah!
Phoebe: Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't 
  even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And 
  they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant 
  people!
Ross: That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Rachel: Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
Ross: Ah, and where is Joey?
Rachel: I said it's still nap time.
(Joey comes out from his room, yawning)
Ross: (taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
Joey: 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his ""How You Doin'"" 
  line)

Ross: Joey, NO!
Joey: What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
Ross: When they see this you'll be 52!
Joey: And starting to think about settling down!
Rachel: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents 
  on?
Joey: I'd love to! Yeah! 

Joey: (To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents?
Phoebe: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Joey: Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
Phoebe: Joey, it's a birthday party.
Joey: Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed 
  for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as 
  a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""El-moo""! 
  (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!
(Monica and Chandler enter)
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Rachel: Oh, she's still napping
Chandler: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party 
  she knows is happening.
Rachel: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't 
  a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a 
  first birthday again.
Monica: All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and 
  get the fun time started!
Rachel: No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
Monica: Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
(someone knocks on the door. Rachel goes to open it)
Jack and Judy: HI!
Ross: (points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!
Monica: So glad you came!
Jack: I can't believe Emma is already one!
Judy: (to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the 
  attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to 
  take him to the emergency room!

Ross: (pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know 
  about your dad!
Joey: Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
Jack: Thank you!
Joey: Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what 
  would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
Jack: Which one are you?

(Time lapse)
Monica: I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
Chandler: I know, what are we gonna do?
Monica: I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really 
  hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
Chandler: I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Joey: Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, 
  maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!

Phoebe: So you‚Äôre gonna... hit on her?
Joey: No, no, no! My talents as an actor!
Phoebe: Oh!
Joey: You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one 
  of her books!
Phoebe: Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Joey: Hey, I think Emma might like it!
Rachel: Oh! Emma might like what?
Joey: Um, my present!
Rachel: What did you get her?
Joey: Actually we prepared performances.
Phoebe: Separate performances.
Joey: But equally real!
Rachel: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are 
  getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind 
  performing them once now?
Phoebe: Sure, yeah!
Joey: (unconfidently) O K.
Rachel: (to everybody) All right, let‚Äôs get this party started, huh? 
  Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
Ross: Oh, great!
Phoebe: (to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing 
  prepared?
Joey: Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole 
  crew waiting!
Rachel: So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
Joey: I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma‚Äôs books.
Rachel: Oh, ok, which one?
Joey: Uh, why, it‚Äôs a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, 
  (he reads the title of the book) ‚ÄúRiding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum 
  depression‚Äù eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) ‚ÄúLove 
  you forever‚Äù. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly 
  books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. 
  A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and 
  forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang ‚ÄúI‚Äôll love 
  you forever, I‚Äôll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby 
  you‚Äôll be‚Äù. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book). 
  And while he rocked her, he sang ‚ÄúI‚Äôll love you forever, I‚Äôll 
  like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you‚Äôll be‚Äù.
Rachel: (crying) Wow! That was amazing!
Ross: Thank you so much for that gift!
Chandler (nearly weeping): I was not ready for this today!
Ross: Amazing... amazing.
Rachel: Oh, Phoebe, I‚Äôm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
Phoebe: That‚Äôs right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to 
  hers. For there‚Äôs no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts 
  singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! 
  Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy 
  birthday Emma!
Rachel: Is that it?
Phoebe: No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks 
  up a book). ‚ÄúSex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.
Everybody: No, no, no, no, no!
[Scene: Joey‚Äôs Apartment. Ross is filming his parents ]
Judy: Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.
Jack: Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.
Judy: Yes, you‚Äôll be all grown up by then. We‚Äôll be... Well your 
  grandfather and I might not be here.
Jack: That‚Äôs true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the 
  grave, Emma!
Judy: After all, my parents died very young.
Jack: And my cholesterol‚Äôs off the charts!
Judy: Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
Ross (stops recording): Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was 
  just... yeah!
Rachel: Ross, um, don‚Äôt forget to get a shot of Emma‚Äôs cake. It‚Äôs 
  in a box in the fridge.
Ross: Sure.
Rachel: Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, 
  Corino‚Äôs.
Monica: Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike 
  there when I was a kid.
Rachel: Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different 
  shapes, and if you give them a photo, they‚Äôll copy it in icing!
Monica: Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Rachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Ross: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say 
  for bachelorette parties?
Rachel: Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! 
  They put my baby‚Äôs face on a penis!
Phoebe (sees the cake): oh! Now it‚Äôs a party!
Rachel: Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to 
  be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
Joey (staring at the cake): Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
Judy:(to Jack) Jack, look at this.
Jack: I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
Ross: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Rachel (on the phone): No, no, this is not what I ordered. 
  Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for 
  my daughter‚Äôs birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
Ross: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby‚Äôs face off the 
  penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!
Rachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even 
  want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a 
  piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!
Joey: I'm so confused!
Rachel: (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want 
  my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with 
  nuts!
Chandler: To be fair this one does have nuts.
(Time lapse)
(Ross, Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen area)
Ross: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could 
  go and get the cake.
Monica: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key! 
Ross: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message 
  to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica 
  and Chandler) Ok!
Chandler: Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Monica: We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.
  You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
Chandler: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together 
  and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed 
  and switches the camcorder off)
Monica: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to 
  go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in 
  a half hour.
Phoebe: And you know, I have a massage client soon.
Ross: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be 
  back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
Monica: Alright, 5 more minutes.
(The phone rings, Ross picks up)
Ross: (Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some 
  more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right 
  there. (Puts the phone down)
Chandler: Was that Emma? Is she up? 
Ross: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot 
  her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
Phoebe: Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna
go.
Monica: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) 
  We've been complaining the longest!
Ross: No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad 
  that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes 
  back here and all you guys are gone?
Chandler: I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday! 
Ross: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)
Joey: Got it! (Goes towards the front door
  and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going? 
Chandler: To the bathroom!
Joey: Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna 
  be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
Phoebe: Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards 
  the bathroom and enter)
Chandler: (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and 
  Joey come out looking shocked)
Joey: Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
Phoebe: No, it did not.
Joey: No.
Judy: Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at 
  night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.
Jack: Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger 
  scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.
Judy: Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
Joey: Ok! (Opens the door for them) 
Judy: Bye... Bye dear.
Joey: Nighty-night!
Judy: Nighty-night!
Joey: Bye, bye.
Phoebe: Joey? How could you just let them leave?
Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he 
  fought for our country.
Monica: No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Joey: (Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you 
  guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)
Chandler: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Joey: Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
(The phone rings, Joey picks up)
Joey: Hello?
Estelle: (on the other side of the line) Joey! It's Estelle!
Joey: Hey! (smiles)
Estelle: So, how did your audition go today?
Joey: (smile fades) What audition?
Estelle: The one I told you about last week?
Joey: What? You never said anything about an audition!
Estelle: (Looks confused) Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. 
  I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to 
  have a monologue prepared.
Joey: A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for 
  his ""dramatic reading"") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) 
  Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
Phoebe: Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client 
  waiting outside my door any minute!
Monica: Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right 
  now!
Phoebe: Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as 
  the person who realized that, I get to go!
Monica: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Joey: Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever 
  gets the highest number gets to go first.
Monica: (She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.
Joey: Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
Phoebe: No, lets just draw straws.
Joey: Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
Chandler: I'm begging you stop.
Joey: Right.
Monica: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. 
  We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
Phoebe: (Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!
Chandler: (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going 
  to do in Vermont! 
Monica: Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)
Phoebe: Ok! I want the dolphin!
Chandler: Thats a bear.
Phoebe: I'm too excited!
Monica: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler 
  and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks 
  the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes 
  in last, stays!
Joey: Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)
Chandler: Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
(Monica, Phoebe and Joey release their wind-up toys.)
Phoebe: Go! Go!
Joey: Come on robot!
(Phoebe's bear takes the lead, followed by Joey's robot, and far behind is 
  Chandler and Monica's dog, which walks a few paces, stops and starts barking, 
  sits, walks again, and so on... )
Monica: (to the dog) What are you barking at?
(While Phoebe's bear is still in the lead, it is now closely followed by Joey's 
  robot. Chandler and Monica's dog however, sits down, barking... and does a backflip.)
Monica: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Chandler: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
(Meanwhile the race has been won by Phoebe's bear, followed by Joey's robot)
Joey: Way to go robot!
Phoebe: Good job Alan!
Joey: Hey, good race you guys.
Phoebe: Yeah, see you later!
(Joey and Phoebe leave for the door)
Monica: No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly 
  stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog 
  never crossed the finish line, so technically...
Chandler: They left.
(Monica turns to see the closed door.)

[ Scene: The freeway. Rachel is driving Monica's Porsche, while 
  using her mobile phone. Ross is sitting next to her.]

Rachel: (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just 
  gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna 
  be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...
(She hangs up, closes her phone, turns around and puts it in her bag which 
  is in the back of the car. While doing this and not looking at the road, she 
  turns the steering wheel by accident, which makes the car swerve.)
Ross: RACHEL!
Rachel: OOH! God! Sorry!
Ross: (sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a 
  good driver.
(Ross fastens his seat belt.)
Rachel: Emma's awake.
Ross: Yeah?
Rachel: I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're 
  not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Ross: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. 
  (he opens the box)
Rachel: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... 
  And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According 
  to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
Ross: Rach, she's not going to remember this.
Rachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this 
  day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her 
  cake singing ""Happy Birthday"". Then we would all go into... HEY GET 
  OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks 
  at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!
Ross: (looks back at the cake) Hey!
Rachel: What?
Ross: It's not bad.
Rachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a 
  bunny. How did you do that?
Ross: Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this 
  to make ears.
Rachel: Well, I'm very impressed.
Ross: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into 
  woodland creatures.

[ Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma 
  are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of 
  them.]

Monica: Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
Chandler: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Monica: Game?
Chandler: Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, 
  that's little.
(With his index finger he shows her how old she is. Emma also points her finger 
  and babbles...)
Chandler: Ooh! That's my girl!
Monica: That's how old you are.
Chandler: Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Monica: (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...
Chandler: Me too...
(There's a couple of seconds of silence. Then Chandler looks around...)
Chandler: There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Monica: ...and head to Canada!
Chandler: I was kidding.
Monica: I wasn't. Let's get going!
(Phoebe enters the apartment again.)
Phoebe: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
Chandler: No, not yet.
Phoebe: Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
Monica: What about your massage client?
Phoebe: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, 
  you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
(Joey comes running into the apartment, out of breath.)
Joey: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE 
  TIME!
(Ross and Rachel enter.)
Joey: (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!
Ross: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Rachel: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks 
  you guys!
Chandler: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
Rachel: What?
Chandler: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index 
  finger again)
Emma: Wo-ish. (and holds up her finger)
(Ross and Rachel gasp)
Rachel: Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Ross: Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
Rachel: (angrily) NO, no science camp!
Ross: Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Rachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
Monica: Thanks!
Ross: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow 
  out the candle. Come on Emma.
Chandler: Let's do it, come on!
(Rachel wipes away some tears.)
Ross: What's wrong? Are you okay?
Rachel: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
Phoebe: (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.
Joey: What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it 
  was a penis.

Rachel: You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her 
  first cookie.
Joey: Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
Rachel: I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
Joey: No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from 
  a can!
Monica: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we 
  were wondering if you would write one for us.
Rachel: Of course, I'd be honored!
Chandler: Thanks!
Monica: Thank you!
(Joey looks at them, disappointed about their decision)
Joey: U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
Chandler: Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Monica: Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much ""with 
  the words"".
Joey: Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
Monica: Clearly we were wrong.
Joey: I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how 
  much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
Monica: You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Joey: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... ""Dear baby 
  adoption decider people...""
Chandler: So excited about your letter!
(Phoebe enters)
Phoebe: Hey!
All: Hey Phoebe!
Joey: Hey!
Monica: Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Phoebe: Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Rachel: OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, 
  first time you had sex...
Phoebe: YEAH!
Chandler: So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Phoebe: Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
Joey: Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
Phoebe: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so 
  no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put 
  on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
Monica: You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in
our bathroom!
Chandler: That's where people make number two!!

OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Ross' apartment. Ross is grading papers. Charlie approaches 
  him.]
¬†
Charlie: Hey! (They kiss and cuddle a little)
Ross: Hey...
Charlie: So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
Ross: (surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to 
  but I really have to grade these papers.
Charlie: Fine, it's fine... (she whispers) I'll just shower by myself...
Ross: (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!
Charlie: Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
Ross: Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
(they start kissing but someone knocks at the door)
Ross: Damnit!
Amy: (yelling from outside) Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! (she knocks 
  on the door again) I have to talk to you!!
Ross: (he opens the door) Hi Amy!
Amy: You're not Rachel.
Ross: Still sharp as a tack!
Amy: Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
Charlie: Hi!
Amy: Hi!
Charlie: Nice to meet you.
Amy: H-Hi!!(to Ross) And you are...?
Ross: (pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together 
  last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Amy: (looks confused) N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
Ross: (gives up) Yes, yes, you did.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment]

(Ross enters the apartment with Amy)
Ross: Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need
  pec implants! 

Rachel: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?
Amy: Yeah! Hey, sure! The ""Days of Our Lives"" guy!
Joey: That's right, yeah.
Amy: You're not good!
Joey: Always nice to meet a fan!
Rachel: So now, what are you doing here?
Amy: Well, I have huge news.
Rachel: (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just 
  check on the baby!
Amy: Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma)
Ross: Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Amy: Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
Ross: What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Amy: Hey, your English is getting better!!
Ross: (to Joey) Oh my God!
Joey: I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Ross: What... what you working on?
Joey: (using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it 
  to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Ross: Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Joey: What did I just say?
Ross: Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word 
  you want to change.
  Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list 
  of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
Joey: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) 
  ""brainy, bright, clever"", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey 
  Tribbiani's got the whole package!!

[Scene: Rachel's room. Rachel is attending to Emma. Amy is standing 
  behind her.]
¬†
 Rachel: God!
Amy: So beautiful.
Rachel: Oh, I know, isn't she?
Amy: No, I was talking about your bedding.
Rachel: All right. What's your news, Amy?
Amy: Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
Rachel: What? Oh my God! To who?
Amy: This guy! He has a killer apartment.
Rachel: A-And??
Amy: A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
Rachel: No, what's he like?
Amy: Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
Rachel: Yeah.
Amy: It's his dad.
Rachel: Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
Amy: Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
Rachel: Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the 
  apartment more than you like...
Amy: Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
Rachel: Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married 
  somebody that I didn‚Äôt love. Do you remember Barry?
Amy: Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went 
  to sleep.
Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but
  anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever
  made. Honey, you deserve
  true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age,
  that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
Amy: (thinks about it) You‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre right! I‚Äôm gonna 
  do it!
Rachel: Ok.
Amy: I‚Äôm gonna marry Myron and keep looking
  for Mr
Right.
Rachel: Ok, let‚Äôs keep talking.

[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Mike and Phoebe are walking to 
  their seats.]

Phoebe: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking 
  at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they‚Äôre in my 
  seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can‚Äôt believe 
  it's been a whole year! 
Mike: I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so 
  he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
Mike: I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
Phoebe: YOU‚ÄôRE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE 
  AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT‚ÄôS 
  OUR ANNIVERSARY!
Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the 
  big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the 
  screen there‚Äôs written ‚ÄòJulie, will you marry me?‚Äô and goes 
  on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)
Phoebe: Oh how lame... oh, it‚Äôs so tacky, and impersonal.
Mike: Really?
Phoebe: Oh, it‚Äôs the worst way to propose!
Mike: (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes 
what she did).

[Scene: Monica‚Äôs apartment. Joey enters the room]
¬†
Joey: Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to 
  Chandler) Here. And I think you‚Äôll be very, very happy. It‚Äôs the 
  longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
Chandler: (reading) I don‚Äôt... uh... understand.
Joey: (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated 
  for ya?
Monica: (also reading it) It doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
Joey: Of course it does! It‚Äôs smart! I used the the-saurus!
Chandler: On every word?
Joey: Yep!
Monica: Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to 
  Joey)
Joey: Oh, ‚ÄòThey are warm, nice, people with big hearts‚Äô.
Chandler: And that became ‚Äòthey are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens 
  with full sized aortic pumps...?
Joey: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
Monica: Hey Joey, I don‚Äôt think we can use this.
Joey: Why not?
Monica: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what‚Äôs-wrong-with-that' 
  look). Hey, why don‚Äôt you stop worrying about sounding smart and just 
  be yourself!
Chandler: You know what? You don‚Äôt need a thesaurus, just write from 
here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
¬†
[Scene: The corridor. Amy knocks Joey‚Äôs door and Rachel 
  opens the door.]
¬†
Rachel: Amy, hi!
Amy: I took your advice, I left Myron.
Rachel: Oh, good for you! 
Amy: I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
Rachel: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
Amy: Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
(Joey comes out of Monica‚Äôs apartment and sees Rachel and Amy but does 
  not notice the huge amount of bags)
Joey: Ah, look who‚Äôs back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH, 
  WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
Amy: Well, I‚Äôm staying with you guys!
Joey: What?
Amy: We‚Äôre gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey, 
snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!
¬†
[Scene: Joey‚Äôs apartment. Rachel is in the living room 
  and Joey comes out of his room.]
¬†
Joey: You slept out here?
Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‚ÄòMyron, get 
  off!‚Äô
Joey: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we‚Äôre 
  getting rid of her.
Rachel: Joey, I can‚Äôt do that!
Joey: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping 
  Amy badly) ""Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"" 
  I don‚Äôt need that kind of talk in my house!
Rachel: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she‚Äôs difficult, but I think 
  it‚Äôs really good that she‚Äôs here.
Joey: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she‚Äôs gone?
Rachel: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was 
  a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of 
  me.
Joey: Yeah, Monica made us!
Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don‚Äôt 
  think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn‚Äôt for you guys. 
  See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it‚Äôs gonna 
  take patience, but that‚Äôs ok.
Amy: Good morning.
Joey: Yeaah.
Rachel: Amy, that‚Äôs what I was supposed to wear today, that‚Äôs why 
  I hung it on the door.
Amy: Oh, sweety, you can‚Äôt pull this off.
Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time 
  for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
Amy: Oh, I can‚Äôt, honey. I‚Äôm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points 
  at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands) 
  Oh... sure you wanna eat that?
Joey: (yelling at her) I‚ÄôM CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
¬†
[Scene: Monica‚Äôs Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler 
  are there, Phoebe enters the room]
¬†
Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last
year.
Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote 
  me a rap song.
Ross: Seriously?
Chandler: Word!
Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that.
Rachel: Well, what happened?
Phoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the 
  big screen thing...
Rachel: Oh, that is so tacky.
Phoebe: Well, that‚Äôs what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning 
  on proposing to me that same way last night!
Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
Rachel: Phoebe, that‚Äôs huge!
Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him?
Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna 
  propose to me, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever gonna ask again! I mean, 
  I said no in Barbados and now this!
Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself
  mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a
  guy..?
Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to 
  him!
Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
Monica: I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, 
  moving on...
Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Monica: Thank you.
Phoebe: (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think
  I should propose?
Rachel: I think it could be kind of great!
Ross: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen?
Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands 
  together, faking excitement)
Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, 
  plus he'd never suspect it!
Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points 
  to Ross and Chandler) like that?
Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think? 
(Amy walks in carrying a phone handset)
Amy: (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)
Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years 
  ago!!
Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes 
  back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! 
  (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? 
  Because my throat's been hurting?
Rachel: Menstrual cramps.
Ross: I don't think that's what this is.
Rachel: (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?
Monica: No, sorry sweety..
Phoebe: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
Rachel: (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
Amy: Well, I can do it.
Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually... 
Ross: (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other 
  side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Rachel: Why not?
Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!

Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Ross: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one?
Ross: (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Rachel: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge 
  breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
Ross: I... I don't know..
Rachel: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points 
  at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand 
  how important that is in our world?
(Amy approaches from behind)
Amy: um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... 
  Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's 
  been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)
(Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently)
Rachel: Absolutely.
Amy: (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up 
and leaves)
¬†
[Scene: Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk 
  in.]
¬†
Chandler: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Joey: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
(Chandler and Monica look shocked)
Monica: You dropped it off?
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Joey: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to 
  hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)
Monica: You hand-wrote it?
Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at
  all! See ya later! (Leaves)
Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our 
  file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples 
  that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just 
  call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
Monica: Okay good.
Chandler: (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped 
  off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... 
  okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
Monica: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way 
  to the bird store.
Chandler: (Still looks confused) They loved it.
Monica: What?
Chandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a
  child write the recommendation letter.
Monica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?
Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
(Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller)
Amy: Hi!
Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today?
Amy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
Chandler: That sounds like fun.
Amy: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
(Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma)
Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
Amy: I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?
Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah!
(Amy takes off Emma's hat)
Amy: Ta-daaa!
(Rachel looks at Emma)
Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?
Amy: (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
(Rachel looks very shocked)
COMMERCIAL BREAK

Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me? 
Amy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would 
  it?
Chandler: I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) 
  ... but I am wrong!
Rachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Amy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)
(Ross enters)
Ross: Hey guys. 

Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.
Ross: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. 
  (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).
Rachel: Nah, I don't really want her to see. 
Ross: Why not?
Monica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Chandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was 
  in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Ross: Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!
(Rachel looks worried)
Ross: (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?
Rachel: Nothing.
Ross: (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from 
  him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he 
  realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons. 
Rachel: Oh, they're real!
Ross: Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have 
  left Emma with her!
Rachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy)
  You are soo irresponsible
  I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
Amy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs 
  to have a cool fun aunt!
Monica: I'm a cool, fun aunt!
Amy: (Sarcastically) O-Okay!
Chandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Rachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure 
  out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
Amy: Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going 
  to do with my life.
Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when?
Amy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.
Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?
Ross: That's not a thing!
Amy: Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what 
  colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
Rachel: (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.
Amy: Enter Amy!
Ross: (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
Amy: What? What are you gonna do?
Ross: (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!
(Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant 
and looks at Ross who gestures ""later"".)
¬†
[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the 
  game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.]
¬†
Mike: Great game, huh?
Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)
Mike: Why do you keep looking at the screen?
Phoebe: I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank 
  you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?
Mike: Going go to the bathroom.
Phoebe: Well, I think you should wait.
Mike: Why?
Phoebe: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the 
  nutrients.
Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the 
  big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
(We see the screen where it says: ""Mike will you marry me?"" and then 
  we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of 
  Mike.)
Phoebe: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)
Announcer: Get a load of this... She's proposing
  to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
  (people are laughing, while
  Mike still seems bewildered)
Phoebe: That's not very enlightened!
(There's booing around them, and Mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand 
  in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him)
Phoebe: Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!
¬†
[Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone 
  rings.]
¬†
Joey: (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... 
  Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home 
  right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was 
  nice!
(Rachel and Amy enter)
Rachel: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Joey: Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)
Amy: You're kicking me out? 
Rachel: You put holes in my baby's ears!
Amy: Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
Rachel: (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help
  you. You are so  beyond help.
Amy: You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
Rachel: Excuse me?
Amy: You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, 
  I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing 
  at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy?
Rachel: (yelling) Joey, where are those bags?
Joey: (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!
Amy: You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. 
  Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without 
  that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...
Rachel: (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?
Amy: hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
Rachel: Hips or thighs?
Amy: Ass and face.
Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Amy: She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking 
  about real stuff.
Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.
Amy: You can?
Rachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... 
  you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
Amy: (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look
cute.
Rachel: Did you just say Emma?
Amy: Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.

[Scene: Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]
¬†
Phoebe: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking 
  about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
Mike: But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
Phoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider 
  it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, 
  I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball 
  game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who 
  hides it in the cake.
(Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.)
Phoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it?
Mike: (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he 
  takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)
Phoebe: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm 
  sorry!
Mike: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and 
  all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my 
  life with you.
(Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face)
Mike: I'm gonna do this now.
Phoebe: Oh my God!
(Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.)
Mike: Phoebe, I...
Phoebe: Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring 
  finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was 
  wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)
Mike: Ready?
Phoebe: Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)
Mike: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry 
  me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow 
  old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Phoebe: Yes!
(Mike puts the ring on her finger)
Mike: I love you!
Phoebe: I love you more!
Mike: Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna 
  be Mrs. No Balls.
(They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.)
COMMERCIAL BREAK
¬†
[Scene: The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are 
  walking on the sidewalk.]
¬†
Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
Amy: Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies 
  are ugly. 
Rachel: That's shocking!
Amy: Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand, 
  whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to 
  Rachel) He's rude!

Phoebe: (she enters) Hey...
All: Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Pheebs, what's wrong?
Phoebe: Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...
   (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!
All: OH!
Rachel: My God!
Joey: Hey!

Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!
Ross: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, 
  or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise, 
  I like proposals!
Phoebe: Well, it was really sweet, and like the
  most romantic thing ever.
Joey: Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe) 
  Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... 
  (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!
All: Whoo!
Phoebe: Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for 
  you!
Rachel: Mmh-mmh!
Phoebe: It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers 
  of all the guys I've dated.
Rachel: Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, 
  I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends? 

Phoebe: I would, but you're the last one.
Rachel: (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start 
  reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, ""Guy-in-van""?
Phoebe: Oh, my first love! 
Rachel: Oh!
Monica: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Phoebe: Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no,
  he  was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave
  at Omaha Beach.
Chandler: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my 
  black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. 
  With Janice's phone number on it.
Rachel: Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Phoebe: (proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.

OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]
¬†
Chandler: (he enters) Hey honey!
Joey: (Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. 
  Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!
Chandler: Is Monica not here?
Joey: No.
Chandler: Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for
  a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
Joey: Cool!
Chandler: Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas
   were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were
  mine!!!
Joey: That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
Chandler: Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're 
  right for the part.
Joey: What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! 
  Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired! 
  (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh?? 
  Come on! What can't I do?
Chandler: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think 
  you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
Joey: I can do that! (in a deeper voice) ""Hello, I'm 
  your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. 
  I like to use..."" Oh, what's the product?
Chandler: Software that facilitates inter-business networking 
  e-solutions?
Joey: (after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!

¬†
[Scene: Central Perk. Charlie is sitting on the couch and Ross 
  enters.]
¬†
Ross: (to Charlie) Hey!
Charlie: Hey!
Ross: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research
  grant!  I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you. 
Charlie: Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand 
  up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations! 
Ross: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds
   of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not
  
  that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Charlie: Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
Ross: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get
   it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there
   will be  an article about me in the ""Paleontology Review""! Yeah!
   That'll be  the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious
   questions 
  about my work!
Charlie: Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
Ross: Yeah. Why?
Charlie: Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
Ross: Your ex-boyfriend?
Charlie: Yeah.
Ross: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new 
  boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Charlie: No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, 
  I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner 
  together, and I can introduce you.
Ross: Well, if you think it would help.
Charlie: Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
Ross: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, 
  butter him up? Anything he really likes?
Charlie: Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
Ross: We'll see how dinner goes.
¬†
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She is packing a few tings into boxes.]
Phoebe: (looking at Monica entering) Hey! 
Monica: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Phoebe: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing 
  out stuff, so Mike could move in.
Monica: Oh, right.
Phoebe: Yeah. 
Monica: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you 
  with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Phoebe: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did
  you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
Monica: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you  to give  up?

Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me 
  to get rid of Gladys.
Monica: Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting 
  with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and 
  she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!
Phoebe: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh,
  I know!! Oh, you should take her!
Monica: (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
Phoebe: Why, you don't like her?
Monica: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll 
  take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too 
  easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Phoebe: Really? You think?
Monica: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him ""I'm sorry 
  Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!""
Phoebe: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just 
  realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
Monica: Damn it, I did not think this through!

[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel, Joey and Emma are there.]
¬† 
Chandler: Hey you guys. 
Rachel: Hi!
Joey: Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Chandler: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for 
  the part.
Joey: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor 
  you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Rachel: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna 
  be interested in.
Joey (to Chandler): Look, c'mon, please? It's 
  not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I 
  am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, 
  I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a 
  copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
Chandler: Joe...
Joey: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't 
  pass it on to your bosses!
Chandler: Fine!
Joey: Thank you. (he sits down)
Chandler: Work, Joe!
Joey: Damn it! (he leaves)
Chandler (to Rachel): What am I gonna do now?
Joey: Just pass it to your boss!
Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest 
  him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should 
  learn on their own!
Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked 
  it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and 
  they're the bad guys.
Chandler: That's good! I liked it, they didn't. 
  (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake, 
  go to work! (Joey runs away).

[Scene: A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for her ex-boyfriend, 
  Benjamin Hobart]
¬†

Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. 
  I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner 
  party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley 
  or C3PO?
Charlie: (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks 
  like it's just him.
Benjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
Benjamin: So good to see you.
Charlie: Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long 
  and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop)
Ross: I'm ok.
Charlie: I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross 
  Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell 
  you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, 
  (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of 
  the reasons I got into the field.
Benjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've 
  never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice! 
Charlie: Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross' 
  chair).
Benjamin: (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't
   believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?
Charlie: Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh
  my  God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh
  more, and Ross start laughing too).
Benjamin (to Ross): You weren't there!
Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, 
  you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz, 
  mmm.
Charlie: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, 
  while I go to the ladies room?
Benjamin: So, tell me about it.
Ross: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
Benjamin: M-m.
Ross: See, there are still several areas that haven't 
  been fully excavated.
Benjamin: Break up with Charlie!
Ross: What?
Benjamin: What?
Ross: Did you just say ""break up with Charlie""?
Benjamin: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I 
  didn't not say it.
Ross: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
Benjamin: I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so 
  long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much 
  I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
Ross: Are you serious?
Benjamin: If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then 
  I'm joking!
Ross: No!
Benjamin: Joking it is!

[Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters the room.]
¬†
Phoebe: Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
Monica: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you 
  keep the painting?
Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me 
  keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news 
  is, Gladys is yours!
Monica: Wow, what's the bad news!
Rachel: Who's Gladys?
Phoebe: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, 
  with the woman coming out of the frame.
Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?
  In her house? I am so jealous!
Phoebe: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
Monica: Huh!
Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already 
  gave that to Monica, so...
Monica: You know, I would give her up, for you.
Rachel: No, I couldn't let you do that.
Monica: But I want to.
Rachel: But I don't want you to.
Monica: But I insist!
Rachel: But I insist harder!
Phoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, 
  she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the 
  coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!
Monica: No, that landed in your food!
Rachel: (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair
   and square. I'm so sad!

[Scene: Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]
¬†
Chandler: Hey Joe!
Joey: What's up?
Chandler: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along 
  to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Joey: (sounds disappointed) Oh.
Chandler: (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.
Joey: (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched 
  the tape?
Chandler: (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey 
  continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. 
  Stupid sons of bitches!
Joey: (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape.
Chandler: (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!
Joey: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
Chandler: I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
Joey: Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room 
  and is observing the conversation)
Chandler: I watched it!
Joey: Keep going Pinocchio!
Chandler: (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!
Joey: (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards 
  his room)
Chandler: (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. 
  (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)
Rachel: Did you watch the tape?
Chandler:(In a sarcastic ""of course not""!-tone) 
  No!

[Scene: Interview room. Ross and two other professors (one man, 
  one woman) are sitting on one side of a long desk. Benjamin Hobart is sitting 
  on the other side]
¬†
Benjamin: The selection committee has chosen the three of 
  you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers 
  you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you 
  claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you 
  propose to correct this problem?
Dr. Li: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological 
  evidence. I plan to begin there.
Benjamin: (nods) Interesting.
Ross: (Rolls his eyes) I guess!
Benjamin: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. 
  Where might that take place?
Dr. Biely: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
Benjamin: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my 
  birthday?
Ross: (shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... 
  (Benjamin looks at him as if to say ""What's wrong? Answer the question"")
Benjamin: Care to venture a guess?
Ross: (annoyed) May 12th?
Benjamin: (looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even 
  kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many graduate students 
  you'd be needing?
Dr. Li: Half a dozen.
Benjamin: I see, and Dr. Biely?
Dr. Biely: Three for excavation and two for analysis.
Benjamin: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit 
  was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
Ross: (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students. 

Benjamin: No! I'm sorry, we were looking for ""Baby It's 
  You"". Baby It's You.
Ross: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my 
  questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
Benjamin: You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. 
  Spell ""Boscodictiasaur"".
Ross: (annoyed) um... I've never heard of a ""Boscodictiasaur"".
Benjamin: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
Ross: (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it 
  correctly) B - O - S ...
Benjamin: No, it starts with a silent ""M"".
Ross: Oh come on!!

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are 
  talking.]
¬†
Chandler: I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
Rachel: But you are a liar.
Chandler: What did I just say?
(Joey comes out of his room)
Joey: You still here?
Chandler: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am 
  insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
Joey: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? 
  First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about 
  lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying 
  about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in 
  the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!
Chandler: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Joey: (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? 
  (goes back into his room) 
Rachel: Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)
Joey: (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't 
  watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this 
  tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I 
  got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play 
  and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)
(The commercial:
Joey says ""Ichiban"". It displays a few girls dancing around and Joey 
  fills most of the screen, he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them 
  saying ""Lipstick For Men!"" It goes on to show him playing a guitar 
  and putting on more blue lipstick. In the end he says seductively ""Ichiban... 
  Lipstick For Men"" and ""Sahiko"" and it ends. Chandler and Rachel 
  are speechless.)

Joey: (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you 
  didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door). 
(Silence)
Chandler: He really is a chameleon.

[Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters carrying the horrific 
  'painting' of Gladys. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
¬†
Phoebe: (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to 
  your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')
Monica: (faking happiness) Oh, my! 
Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, 
  she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh 
  so proudly? (looks around for a spot)

Monica: (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to 
  do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Rachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to 
  the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be 
  the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Phoebe: (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can 
  get rid of that French poster.
Monica: (offended) I like that poster!
Phoebe: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. 
  Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's 
  nothing above your bed!!
Monica: (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?
[Scene: Ross' office. Ross is pacing and Benjamin enters]


Ross: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology 
  related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling) 
  Aunt Margaret's pants size?
Benjamin: I've come here to apologize. I think I may have 
  let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process. 
Ross: (Sarcastic) No! Stop! 
Benjamin: Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant. 
Ross: (Skeptical) Really?
Benjamin: Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
Ross: I have to break up with Charlie?
Benjamin: Hey, you got one right!
(Ross shakes his head) 
Ross: You're crazy.
Benjamin: Crazy, or... romantic?
Ross: Crazy!
Benjamin: Ooor...
Ross: (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]
(Rachel enters, checking the mail, then looks up and sees Gladys placed on 
  the barcalounger.)
Rachel: O-oh my God!
Joey: (enters from his bedroom) What?
Rachel: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
Joey: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very 
  reasonable price.
Rachel: Joey, we're not keeping this!
Joey: But it's an original Buffay...
Rachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't 
  mind that she's haunted. 
Joey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
Rachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive 
  when you're asleep.
(Joey's eyes are twice their size now, and looks nervously from Rachel to Gladys 
  and back.)
Rachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body 
  across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) 
  And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your 
  doorknob.
Joey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
(Joey leaves for his bedroom, and Rachel grins. She then takes Gladys and enters 
  Monica's apartment.)
Monica: Hey! I sold that to Joey.
Rachel: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at 
  this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)
Monica: No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes 
  the painting back to Rachel)
Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again)
Monica: No you can't. She's yours!
Rachel: She's yours!
Monica: SHE'S YOURS!
Rachel: She's yours!
(While they are both pushing the painting towards each other, Phoebe enters)
Phoebe: Hey! (there's a pause)
Rachel: She's mine!
Monica: She's m-i-i-ne!
Rachel: She's mine!
Monica: She's mine!
Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her 
  anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous 
  painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress 
  and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls 
  are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are 
  gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)
Rachel: I want Gladys!
Monica: She's mine!
Rachel: She's mine!
Monica: She's mine!
Rachel: She's mine!
[Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey's home alone, reading a Sports 
  Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And 
  I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part 
  or not.
Joey: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you 
  lied.
Chandler: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you 
  to forgive me?

[Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch.]
Monica: Oh my God!
(we see Joey and Chandler standing there, and Chandler is wearing the blue 
  Ichiban lipstick!)
Rachel: Excellent!
Joey: Now, what do you say?
Chandler: Lying is wrong!
Joey: And?... AND?
Chandler: I'm a pretty little girl.
Phoebe: I knew it!

[Scene: Central Perk. Some time later that day. The group has 
  left and Charlie is there when Ross enters.]
Ross: Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
Charlie: Did you get the grant?
Ross: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your 
  ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
Charlie: What?
Ross: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't 
  give you up.
Charlie: Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up 
  with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
Ross: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, 
  who was the voice of ""Underdog""?
Charlie: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
Ross: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? 
  I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Charlie: Seriously?
Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do 
  you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Charlie: Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then 
  M-B-O... 
Ross: Damnit!

[Scene: Benjamin's office. Ross and Charlie are entering.]
Benjamin: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are 
  you doing here?
Ross: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you 
  tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the 
  voice of Underdog!
Benjamin: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, 
  this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in 
  the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Charlie: Benji?
Benjamin: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's 
  only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in 
  my life.
Ross: Too little, too late, Benji!
Charlie: I can't believe this.
Benjamin: I never should have broken up with you. I think 
  about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me? 
Ross: (indignant) No!
Charlie: Yes!
Ross: What?
Charlie: I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... 
  romantic.
Ross: or...
Benjamin: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, 
  but is there any chance you will take me back?
Charlie: Maybe...
Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a 
  little uncomfortable.
Charlie: Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her hand 
  on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
Benjamin: (puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm sorry 
  too...
(Charlie and Benji both let their hands slide down Ross's face, until their 
  hands meet, and they hold hands.)
Benjamin: I love you!
Charlie: I love you too! (and they start to kiss)
Ross: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!

  COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Joey's bedroom. Joey's asleep with Hugsy, the penguin 
  right next to him.]
(There are scratching and squeaking noises coming from the living room, and 
  Joey wakes up, terrified. He pulls his blanket higher. The doorknob is turning.)
Joey: Gladys?
(The door opens, and there is Gladys, still in her frame though. Joey panics 
  and moves frantically, screaming. Then there is laughing, and the painting is 
  lowered. It was Rachel holding Gladys.) 
Rachel: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not 
  get old.
Joey: You're mean!
Rachel: Oh, don't be such a baby!
(She closes his door again, and turns around. Then she starts screaming, terrified. 
  There is Glynnis... And Monica holding her up, laughing.)

[Scene: Central Perk]
(Joey and Ross enter. Phoebe and Mike are sitting on the couch, reading a magazine.)
Ross: Hey you guys!
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Hey, what are you doing?
Mike: Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
Chandler: That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Ross: Yeah!
Phoebe: It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea 
  how expensive this stuff was!
Chandler: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the 
  numbers.
Phoebe: So what did you two do about it?
Chandler: It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting 
  solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Ross: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact 
  that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Mike: I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
Ross: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
Phoebe: But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
Mike: Are you serious?
Phoebe: Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity 
  and we just got married at City Hall?
Mike: I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. (he kisses her)
Ross: I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Chandler: (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Ross: No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But 
  maybe the time after that!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]
(Monica is cleaning the table, Chandler is sitting on the sofa. Joey enters.)
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: What's going on?
Chandler: Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning 
  the apartment.
Monica: (sarcastically) We?
Chandler: You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Joey: Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Chandler: Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Monica: And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about 
  us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Joey: Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very 
  impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
Chandler: (pointing at himself) Little people?
Joey: (pointing at himself) Celebrity.
Monica: Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff 
  hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
Chandler: What...? NO!
Monica: Chandler?
Chandler: (he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended 
  by the insinuation!
Monica: Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes 
  taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
Chandler: I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not 
  mine.
Monica: It isn't mine!
Joey: (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose 
  it is!

¬† 
[Scene: The New York City Children's fund hallway.]
Charity guy: May I help you? 
Phoebe: Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
Charity guy: Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.
Phoebe: Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she 
  gives him a check)
Charity guy: Well, this is very generous!
Phoebe: And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Mike: Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Phoebe: Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Charity guy: Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
Mike: Not necessary.
Phoebe: Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Mike: And ""X"" is spelled uhm... ""Mike Hannigan"".
Charity guy: Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.
Phoebe: Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
Mike: It does. It feels really good!
Phoebe: Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which 
  was on the counter)
Charity guy: Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
Phoebe: Mhm... it's moist.
¬†
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]
Ross: (he enters) Hi!
Rachel: Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Ross: Oh, good!
Rachel: Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Ross: Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists 
  out there.
Rachel: Absolutely.
Ross: There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under 
  a bridge!
Rachel: So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Ross: Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Rachel: Oh my God, what!?
Ross: Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and 
  fire!
Rachel: Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
Ross: Be-caaauuuse...
Rachel: (upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing 
  incident... when I was little.
Ross: Seriously?
Rachel: Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden 
  my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut 
  a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!
Ross: (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you 
  in the movie!
Rachel: Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And 
  I was thinking Claire Danes.
Ross: Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly 
  safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and 
  you'll see!
Rachel: Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and 
  there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're 
  gonna return back to earth!

Ross: Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come 
  on, you know, when you‚Äôll see the look on Emma‚Äôs face, I swear you 
  won‚Äôt regret it.
Rachel: All right!
Ross: Good, you don‚Äôt want to be one of those mothers who pass on their 
  irrational fears on their children, do you?
Rachel: Irrational, huh? All right, well, I‚Äôll remember that the next 
  time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Ross: Oh, yeah, that‚Äôs the same, I am sure there are thirty different 
  species of poisonous swings!

[Scene: Monica‚Äôs apartment. Somebody knocks the door]
Monica: Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
Chandler: Ok, ok, here we go.
Monica: Ok.
Chandler: Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door 
  and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
Phoebe: Hello, is this the creepy residence?
Monica: We‚Äôre waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I‚Äôm glad 
  you‚Äôre here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a 
  box on the table and opens it). I don‚Äôt know if you wanna use it, but‚Ä¶
Phoebe: Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won‚Äôt be needing 
  a veil, I actually won‚Äôt be wearing a dress at all!
Monica: I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding! 
Phoebe: No, no, no, we‚Äôre not having a big reception, we took the money 
  we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
Monica: That‚Äôs crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can‚Äôt 
  imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
Phoebe: We, you know, we‚Äôre different! We don‚Äôt care about having 
  a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh, 
  please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex 
  image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares, 
  I don‚Äôt need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
Monica: That‚Äôs right. You‚Äôre making a commitment and that‚Äôs 
  the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
Phoebe: City Hall.
Monica: Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just 
  there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
Phoebe: It‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs ok. I made my decision. What I really want 
  is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)
Monica: Yay!
Chandler: But you already gave all your money to charity!
Phoebe: Well, I‚Äôll just ask for it back!
Chandler: I don‚Äôt think you can do that!
Monica: Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some 
  stupid kids!
Chandler: That‚Äôs sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.

[Scene: The playground. Ross put Emma on the swing and they‚Äôre 
  ready to play]
Rachel: Ok, careful.
Ross: Ok.
Rachel: Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
Ross: Rach, she‚Äôs got like three hairs!
Rachel: I know (she touches Emma‚Äôs head) but they‚Äôre just so beautiful! 
  Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Ross: I promise you she‚Äôs safe! No watch how much she loves this. 
Rachel: Ok.
Ross (to Emma): Ready sweety?
Rachel: Ok.
Ross: Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)
Rachel: Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, she‚Äôs smiling! Oh my God, 
  she does like it!
Ross: See, I told you!
Rachel: Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, she‚Äôs a little dare-devil! 
  Oh, let me push, can I push?
Ross: Oh, absolutely!
Rachel: Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, it‚Äôs in the diaper bag.
Ross: Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared 
  of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!

¬† 
[Scene: The New York City Children's fund ]
Mike: We‚Äôre seriously asking for our money back?
Phoebe: It‚Äôs for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, 
  because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
Charity guy: Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don‚Äôt 
  think that that‚Äôs ever happened before.
Phoebe (to Mike): Gay, go.
Mike (to the charity guy): Oh my God, I love your shirt!
Phoebe: The donation we made earlier, we k‚Ä¶, we w‚Ä¶, we want it 
  back.
Charity guy: Excuse me?
Phoebe: Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn‚Äôt 
  want, but it turns out we do.
Charity guy: So you‚Äôre asking us to refund your donation to the children?
Mike: Yeah! This feels really good.
Phoebe: I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
Charity guy: Hey, it‚Äôs not my business, (he takes their check from a 
  drawer) besides it‚Äôs probably a good thing. We really would have been 
  spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing‚Ä¶
Phoebe: Hey, that‚Äôs not fair! A person‚Äôs wedding is important! 
  And especially to me! Ok? I didn‚Äôt have a graduation party! And I didn‚Äôt 
  go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an 
  escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to ‚Äúkill me‚Äù 
  or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty 
  little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)
Mike: She could have been talking about either one of us.

[Scene: Monica‚Äôs apartment. Somebody knocks the door]
Laura: Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
Monica: Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
Laura: Thank you!
Monica: Would you like something to drink?
Laura: Oh, water would be fine.
Monica: Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We‚Äôre really excited 
  about getting this process started.
Chandler: Oh, because we love kids. Love ‚Äòem to death.Well, not actually 
  to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... 
  as allowed by law.
Laura: Your place is just lovely.
Monica: Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Laura: You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples 
  in the 
  building adopting?
Monica: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby 
  before 
  them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked)
Chandler: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
Laura: Oh...
Chandler: What?
Laura: I just realized why I remember this place.
Monica: Really? What is it?
Laura: Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building 
  and it 
  didn't end very well.
Monica: Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Laura: Yes!
Chandler: Of course it was!
Laura: Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he 
  would call 
  me and he didn't.
Chandler: RAT BASTARD!
Laura: So you're not friends with him?
Monica and Chandler: OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, 
  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!
Laura: Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning 
  on staying at 
  home with your child... (someone knocks on the door)
Joey: (form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? 
  
  (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it 
  back in 
  his face) OW!
Laura: What was that?
Chandler: Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great 
  with 
  kids though.
¬†
[Scene: Ross and Rachel are at the playground with Emma. Rachel 
  in putting her back in the stroller and Ross is tending to his wound]
Rachel: Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Ross: SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him) 
  (To the 
  kids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go away)
Rachel: Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. 
  That is 
  the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
Ross: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault 
  and kind 
  of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. Who is still laughing. 
  Nice. 
Rachel: Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else 
  gets 
  hurt?
Ross: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, 
  okay? And 
  you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. 
Rachel: (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've 
  always been 
  jealous of my hair.
Ross: Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your 
  silly 
  fears.
Rachel: Alright fine. I'll do it.
Ross: Good.
Rachel: If you hold a spider. 
Ross: (He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT? 
  WHERE? WHERE?
Rachel: IF you hold a spider.
Ross: I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again, 
  
  afraid)

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler is still leaning 
  against the door, keeping Joey out, who is still banging and shouting on the 
  other side.]
Joey: Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
Chandler: (Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Laura: What's going on?
Chandler: Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey 
  bangs on 
  the door again)
Joey: Guys!?
Monica: Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
Joey: What's going on?
Chandler: WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!! 
(cut to Joey on the other side, who finally leaves the door and goes to his 
  apartment)
Joey: Everything doesn't sound fine!
Laura: Is he alright out there by himself?
Chandler: Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Laura: Bert and Ernie!
Chandler: (nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike enter]
Mike: You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm 
  sorry about 
  that.
Phoebe: (Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him. 
Mike: Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really 
  deserve that.
Phoebe: Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for 
  a few 
  seconds) Just like the kids I took the money from.
Mike: No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.
Phoebe: Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
Mike: Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.
Phoebe: And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't 
  shot 
  anyone in a really long time.
¬†
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. They are preparing 
  to show Laura around. Laura is standing with her back to the window, Chandler 
  and Monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other.
Laura: Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child 
  in.
Monica: Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the 
  furniture, 
  because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!
Laura: Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything 
  I need 
  up to here...
(She starts checking her form. Chandler sees movement near the window from 
  
  the corner of his eye and when he looks he spots Joey climbing up the fire escape 
  and 
  onto their balcony. He warns Monica silently.)
Monica: (Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room?
(Joey enters through the side window and jogs towards the kitchen holding a 
  baseball bat)
Chandler: What the hell are you doing?
Joey: Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
Chandler: Well, we're not.
Joey: But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
Chandler: We don't have a code word.
Joey: We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word 
  for danger.
(Monica talks loudly in the baby's room)
Monica: So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey 
  behind 
  the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler)
Monica: (To Chandler) What room should we see next?
Chandler: Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
Monica: (laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people 
  don't 
  get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom).
(Joey gets up and look annoyed)
Joey: (quivering with anger) I did not care for that!
Chandler: (escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept 
  with 
  our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so 
  she can't 
  see you.
Joey: Ok, ok! (He leaves)
Chandler: Ok!
(Joey leaves and closes the door behind him. Chandler walks towards the living 
  room, but then Joey enters again.)
Chandler: What?
Joey: I forgot my bat.
(He picks up his bat and holds it up, but then Monica and Laura enter the living 
  room again. When Laura sees Joey, she freezes...)
Laura: Oh my God!
Chandler: And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And 
  we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)
Laura: What are you doing here?
Joey: (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
Laura: Are you friends with him?
Chandler: I can explain... Joey...
Joey: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back 
  here. I can't believe you never called me.
Laura: Excuse me?
Joey: Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by 
  the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... 
  lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
Laura: I gave you my number, you never called me.
Joey: No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... 
  social work, ok, that you can just... do.
Laura: (embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well, I'm pretty sure I gave 
  you my number.
Joey: Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, 
  we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
Laura: I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...
Joey: No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You 
  know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the 
  apartment, leaving her shocked)
Laura: Joey, wait!
Joey: (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes 
  the door behind him)
Laura: (laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...
Chandler: Oh, that's really ok.
Monica: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
Laura: Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going 
  to make excellent parents.
(Chandler and Monica hug each other, and then Joey enters the apartment again.)
Joey: LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)
¬†
[Scene: The New York City Children's Fund building. Phoebe and 
  Mike are entering.]
Phoebe: (to the Charity guy) We're back!
Charity guy: Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're 
  looking for is an ATM.
Mike: No, no, we're here to give the money back.
Phoebe: Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children. 
(the Charity guy smiles wanting to take the check, but Phoebe pulls it back 
  again. His smile fades.) 
Phoebe: Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she 
  gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!
Charity guy: If I haven't said so already sir, (sarcastically pointing to Phoebe) 
  congratulations!
Mike: (takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping 
  in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this 
  decision for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should do?
Charity guy: You know what? It's not your decision anymore.
Mike: What?
Charity guy: On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
Phoebe: But... but... but we're giving you this!
Charity guy: Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it 
  a contribution. (gives the check to Phoebe)
Phoebe: (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous!
Charity guy: Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful 
  life together.
Mike: Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come 
  back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
Charity guy: Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
Phoebe: Oh, is that you?
Charity guy: No!
¬†
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are sitting in 
  their living room when the phone rings.]
Monica: Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... 
  Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)
Chandler: Wrong number?
Monica: It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on 
  the waiting list.
Chandler: That's great!
Monica: Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's 
  a baby waiting for us. Oh... 
(Chandler and Monica hug and after a while the telephone rings again... Monica's 
  eyes get bigger. Chandler answers.)
Chandler: Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?

  COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: The playground. Ross, Rachel and Emma are still there. 
  Rachel comes walking to Ross and Emma with something between her hands.]
Rachel: Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
Ross: (nervously) Ok...
Rachel: Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)
Ross: (Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok, 
  get on the swing!
Rachel: (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...
(She slowly grabs the chains of the swing, swings her hair back, and sits down.)
Rachel: (more confident) Ok...
(She slowly walks forward and backward, to gain speed...)
Rachel: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
Ross: See?
Rachel: A-alright! I can do this.
Ross: There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used 
  to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
Rachel: That's because he's on your neck.
Ross: Well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of 
  the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
(Ross is now preoccupied with the spider, and forgets that Rachel is still 
  using the swing. While trying to get rid of the spider, he stands in front of 
  Rachel, who bumps into him, throwing him on the ground again.)
Rachel: ROSS!
(Rachel tries to stop mid-swing, and the swing starts to turn from side to 
  side)

  Produced by: Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller  
  Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano & Vanessa 
  Final check by Kim
[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Chandler enter, the others are sitting on the couch.]
Monica: Hey guys!
Rachel: Hi! 
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: We need to talk to you about something.
Chandler: Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
All: What?
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Are you kidding?
Chandler: Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us. 
Ross: (skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Chandler: No, no! We made this decision together. 
Ross: She's putting words in your mouth!
Joey: Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
Rachel: I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
Monica: No, it's not!
Rachel: It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?
Phoebe: Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Monica: Thank you, Pheebs!
Phoebe: Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
Monica: What? You are way off, lady!
Phoebe: Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Monica: That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Chandler: Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Monica: Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
Chandler: We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?

OPENING CREDITS
¬†
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Monica are in there, and Phoebe enters]
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
Monica: You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Phoebe: You're not making the pies yourself?
Monica: No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Rachel: Did you at least win the contest?
Monica: 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
Rachel: Can't wait!
Monica: This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year ""me""!
(Monica leaves)
Phoebe: Hey Rach.
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: What's Emma doing today?
Rachel: Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
Phoebe: Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
Rachel: Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
Phoebe: Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
Rachel: Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Phoebe: (sarcastic) Oh... okay. 
Rachel: Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy... 
Rachel: And a thousand dollars.
Rachel: ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking Ross) what's in the inside is important...
Phoebe: Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
Rachel: Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Phoebe: Well, I was thinking...
Rachel: Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid. 
Phoebe: Yeah!
¬†
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is watching TV and Monica is cooking]
Monica: (Chandler's laughing) Did someone drop the baton again?
Chandler: Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
Monica: (she tastes what she has cooked) I don't get older. I just get better!
Chandler: You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
Monica: You don't know that.
Chandler: Somebody is gonna pick us. 
Monica: Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
Chandler: I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What, he's my favourite author!
Monica: Name one of his books.
Chandler: (after a long pause) ""The Firm""?
Monica: Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
Chandler: You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year. 
Monica: Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
Chandler: I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile"".
Monica: Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it. 
Chandler: Tell me more.
Monica: Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)
Chandler: You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
(Ross and Joey enter)
Ross: Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
Joey: Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Ross: Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Joey: Oh.
Chandler: Oh my God!
Joey: Yeah, they're great seats too!
Ross: Guess where they are?
Joey: Center ice.
Ross: Did I do something to you?
Chandler: Hmm, the game's at one.
Ross: So? 
Chandler: Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
Joey: So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
Chandler: You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
Joey: Dude, two times that happened!
Chandler: Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Ross: He's right, man.
Joey: Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four. 
Chandler: Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
Joey: That's some gentle comedy, dude. (he and Ross leave)
Ross: We're still going at the game, right?
Joey: Yeah!
Ross: Yeah.
¬†
[Scene: Baby beauty contest]
Host: This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
Phoebe: Hey.
Rachel: Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
Phoebe: We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
Rachel: Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
Phoebe: Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
Rachel: Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
Phoebe: (panicking) But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way! 
Rachel: Phoebe, you have to calm down.
Phoebe: Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
Rachel: Really?
Phoebe: Yeah!
Rachel: You heard them say that?
Phoebe: Yeah!
Rachel: All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
Phoebe: Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
Rachel: No, what?
Phoebe: Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
Rachel: No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
Phoebe: Why not!
Rachel: Because I already did!

[Scene: Madison Square Garden]
(there's a lot of shouting and yelling) 
Joey: Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
Ross: Oh! What a game, huh?
Joey: I know, yeah.
Ross: I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Joey: Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been) I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
Ross: Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Joey: Ohhhh! These seats are great!
Ross: I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice (Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Joey: (looks at the time) Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
Ross: Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
Joey: I don't know...
Ross: One more fight!
Joey: Okay.
Ross: Okay.
¬†
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment.]
Monica: Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Chandler: I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
¬†
[Scene: The corridor. Ross and Joey have just arrived.]
Joey: How late are we?
Ross: Forty-five minutes.
Joey: Wow (He opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)
Ross: (handing him his coat) Here!
Joey: Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! (he raises his hands and on his right one there's a Rangers foam finger)
Ross: You may want to lose the foam finger!
Joey: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
(Rachel, Phoebe and Emma arrive)
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh!
Joey: You are not at Thanksgiving?
Rachel: No... 
Phoebe: No, we're late!
Rachel: What are you doing here!
Ross: We're late too! (Rachel screams)
Joey: We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls)
Phoebe: Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Ross: So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Joey: Yeah, where were you!
Ross: Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
Phoebe: Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
Rachel: And I won!
Ross: You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Rachel: Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!
Ross: Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachel's hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
Rachel: Yeah. That's me!
Ross: You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Phoebe: And it looks like she put makeup on her!
Joey: Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
Ross: I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable! 
Rachel: She won a thousand dollars!
Ross: So this is an annual thing?
Joey: (realizing) Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
Phoebe: You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Ross: Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Rachel: Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Joey: All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae. 
Phoebe: Alright, what are we gonna say?
Ross: Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Phoebe: Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
Joey: No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)
Ross: (to Joey) HEY!
¬†
[Scene: Monica's apartment.]
Monica: Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)
Chandler: (peeping) They're out there!
Monica: Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
Chandler: (peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says ""Rangers"" on it. They went to the game!
Monica: (gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Chandler: (looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.
Monica: Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
[Cut to the hall]
(Rachel comes out of her apartment}
Rachel: Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?
Ross: I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Phoebe: We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
Ross: (sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
Rachel: You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
Ross: (Reading the note) We know you're out there. (Rachel gasps)
Joey: (whispering) Who do you think its from?
[time lapse ‚Äì they are still in the hall]
Rachel: Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
Ross: Well, let's just go in there and face them.
Phoebe: Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy. 
Joey: I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
Rachel: Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).
Joey: (smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!
Ross: What is that? 
Joey: That's fire. Beats everything.
Phoebe: Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his ""fire"" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out). 
Joey: Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played. 
Rachel: Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
All: Alright, okay. (Phoebe reaches for the door, and tries to open it but it's locked)
Phoebe: It's locked.
Ross: Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: ""Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy"". 
Rachel: Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
[cut to Monica and Chandler]
Monica: No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Chandler: Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?
Monica: (Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.
Chandler: (relieved) Oh thank God!
[cut to the hall]
Ross: Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
Chandler: (looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
Ross: (to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)
Rachel: You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)
Joey: I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up)
[cut to Monica and Chandler]
Monica: That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
[cut to the hall]
Ross: How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Joey: (holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)
Phoebe: What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Rachel: (gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
Phoebe: Oh yeah!
[cut to Monica and Chandler]
Monica: Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Chandler: Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)
[cut to the hall]
(Rachel comes out of the apartment holding a pot. Joey holds in anticipation and Rachel opens it)
Rachel: Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)
Ross: That's worse than no food.
[cut to Monica and Chandler]
(Monica looks insulted)
Chandler: HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Monica: Stinky?!
Chandler: Please let me stay on this side of the door.
[cut to hall]
Rachel: Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.
Phoebe: Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
Rachel: You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)
Joey: (to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
Ross: I don't know...
Joey: I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.
Ross: (Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it!
(Rachel finally manages to open the door, but the door chain is on.)
Rachel: Oh!
(Joey sticks his head through the gap. Monica and Chandler are now sitting at the dinner table. There is another smaller table full of food standing in front of the front door)
(Monica and Chandler do not look amused by Joeys head in the door)
Joey: Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
(Monica is now smiling)
Chandler: The cranberries...?
Monica: Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
Joey: (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
Chandler: He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)
Joey: Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?
(Ross head appears above Joey's, Rachel's below Joey's and Phoebe's at the bottom)
Ross: I feel terrible.
Phoebe and Rachel: So, so sorry.
Joey: (smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
Chandler: The floating heads do make a good point.
Monica: Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
Rachel: So bad.
Ross : So bad.
Phoebe: So bad.
Monica: (Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in. 
Rachel: Dessert?
Monica: Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Phoebe: Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).
(Monica takes it and reads the label)
Monica: Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Rachel: Congratulatioooons!
Monica: Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Ross: Really girls, not cool.
Chandler: Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
Joey: Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Ross: It's a day to be thankful.
Joey: (to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!
Monica: It's too late for apologies.
Joey: Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Chandler: That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Rachel: Ewww, is that what that is?
Joey: Sorry!
Phoebe: Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
Rachel: Yeah! I'll cook!
Ross: Yeah! Let's go out.
Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Monica: The three of us?
Joey: Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
(Monica gasps and holds her forehead. Phoebe, Rachel and Ross pull back their heads)
Joey: Ha!
(When Joey tries to pull back his head, he notices he is stuck)
Joey: Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
Monica: Joey, that is not gonna work.
Joey: No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
Phoebe: I'll pull you through.
Ross: Okay.
Joey: (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Chandler: A little late for that.
Joey: Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
Monica: Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Chandler: Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
Monica: Bring it.
Joey: I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
(Chandler gives Monica a footlong ""eye dropper"" with the turkey grease in it)
Monica: Here you go!
(She squirts some of the grease along Joey's face.)
Joey: Oh, that smells good!
(And he starts licking the grease which trickles down his face. Monica also squirts some on the other side of his face, and his tongue follows her movements.)
Joey: Okay.
Monica: Okay, try it.
(Joey tries to pull back at all his might.)
Joey: It isn't working.
Monica: Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
Joey: Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
Chandler: Can you ever feel your ears?
Joey: Interesting...
Monica: Chandler, where are your tools?
Chandler: (sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
Monica: I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
Rachel: I lent them to Ross.
Ross: I gave them to Joey.
Joey: I left them at the park.
Monica: Oh!
Ross: (looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Phoebe: I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Ross: Nice!
(The phone rings in Chandler and Monica's apartment)
Monica: Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
Joey: It's really starting to hurt.
Chandler: Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
Phoebe: Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
(Rachel, Ross and Phoebe have their hands full and are stuffing all kinds of things down Joeys pants.)
Joey: Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Chandler: Come on guys, PUSH!
Joey: Yeah! Come on!
Joey and Chandler: PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
(The chain breaks loose from the wall, and because Joey was pushing with all his might, he propells into the kitchen, towards the table with all the food. This table has wheels underneath it, and when Joey falls on this table, he rides into the living room, with all the food falling off, until finally Joey also falls off... Joey gets up quickly, a bit agitated, and acting as nothing happened. He is covered in food stains.)
Chandler: My cranberries!
Joey: (looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over me.
(He licks his fingers, liking it. He offers Chandler a taste.)
Chandler: Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
(Monica enters from the spare bedroom.)
Chandler: (to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
Monica: (very emotional) I don't care.
(Chandler can't believe what he's hearing. He looks at Monica, then at the others, then back at Monica.)
Chandler: What's going on?
Monica: That was the adoption agency...
Chandler: And?
Monica: WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Chandler: Are you serious? (they hug)
Monica: There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
(They all cheer and Rachel, Ross and Phoebe join in for a group hug. Joey also joins, but he stands back a bit, because he is all sticky of the food on him)
Rachel: I'm so happy for you!
Monica: This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
(They all cheer and hug again, but Joey's eating the food off his shirt)
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. The table is set, and there's food on the tables again. They're all there, toasting.]
Rachel: To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
Ross: I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Phoebe: I know. Have you considered pageanting?
Monica: I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)
Joey: Oh, I know how you feel...
(Monica and Chandler are looking curiously at Joey.)
Rachel: Really?
Joey: Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys ""R"" Us... She was in stock!
Chandler: That is the exact same thing.

[Scene: Central Perk. Everyone's sitting on the couch.Monica and Chandler enter]

Chandler:  Hi!
Ross: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
Phoebe: Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
Monica: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Joey: I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
Chandler: And so incorrect!
Monica: She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Ross: Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Chandler: Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Monica: And a lot could still get in our way.
Chandler: Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
Phoebe: What are you gonna name the baby?
Chandler: I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Joey: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
Monica: Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Chandler: So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Monica: You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Chandler: Yes, but...
Monica: Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)
Chandler: Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!

OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe's speaking to a girl.]
Rachel: (to Joey) Hey, who's Phoebe with?
Joey: I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. (the girl leaves and Phoebe goes toward the couch) (to Phoebe) Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: So... who's your friend?
Phoebe: Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
Joey: OW, why, why, why?
Phoebe: Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
Joey: Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
Phoebe: Mandy.
Joey: Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
Phoebe: No.
Joey: I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks at Rachel)
Rachel: Do you think I'm someone else?
Joey: Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
Rachel: Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
Joey: (pointing at himself) Growth!
Phoebe: Fine, I'll give you her number.
Joey: Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy.
Phoebe: SARAH!
Joey: Saraaah.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Rachel: Oh!
Ross: (he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look?
Rachel: Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!
Ross: C'mon! This looks good!
Rachel: Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
Ross: Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Phoebe: Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
Ross: Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress. 
Joey: I can see why, nice shirt!
Ross: You're wearing the same shirt.
Joey: Stupid Gap on every corner!

[Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering with a man.]

Agency guy: Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
Monica: Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Chandler: Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: ""Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?""
Monica: Uh, we're gonna be great.
Chandler: You're gonna be great.
Monica: Well... obviously!
Agency guy: (he enters with Erica) Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
Monica: Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Erica: (whispering) Hi...
Chandler: Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Erica: Hi.
Agency guy: I'll let you get acquainted.
Chandler: Ok.
Erica: So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
Chandler: That's what our friends call us.
Erica: Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.
Monica: I don't know about that.
Erica: You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
Chandler: (astonished) I don't think that's exactly...
Monica: (overlapping) Let her finish, doctor.
¬†
[Scene: Central Perk]

Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Hey.
Phoebe: Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Joey: Well...
Phoebe: Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
Joey: Nope.
Phoebe: What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Joey: Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere... 
(Sarah picks up some fries from Joey‚Äôs plate and Joey looks very angry. Then we‚Äôre back to Central Perk and Joey does a you-see-what-I-mean look to Phoebe)
Phoebe: That‚Äôs it? That‚Äôs why you won‚Äôt go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
Joey: Hey, hey, look! It‚Äôs not about a few fries... it‚Äôs about what the fries represent.
Phoebe: What?
Joey: ALL FOOD!
Phoebe: I‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don‚Äôt order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That‚Äôs a good way to lose some fingers!
(Rachel enters from the main door)
Phoebe: (to Rachel) Oh
Rachel: Hi
Phoebe: Thank God you‚Äôre here. Listen to this!
Rachel: what?
Phoebe: Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
Rachel: Oh! Oh, no!
(Joey looks satisfied)
Phoebe: What? You know about the plate thing?
Rachel: Oh, yeah. Joey doesn‚Äôt share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
Phoebe: (to Joey) You wouldn‚Äôt let her have a grape?
Rachel: Oh no! Not me! Emma!
(Phoebe looks horrified and she turns to watch Joey)
Joey: (mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN‚ÄôT SHARE FOOD!
Phoebe: Well, I still think that it‚Äôs a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
Joey: (he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I‚Äôll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about?
[Scene: A clothes store. Ross and Phoebe are shopping]

Phoebe: (to Ross) This place is awesome!
Ross: You know, we should just go, I‚Äôm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous! 
(Rachel arrives with a lot of clothes)
Rachel: Ah, this place is great!
Phoebe: Wow!
Ross: Rach, come on, I‚Äôm not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).
Rachel: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful!
Ross: (feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Rachel: Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
Ross: Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
Phoebe (walking to Ross carrying a black leather jacket): Hey, check this out! It‚Äôs totally you!
Ross: Wow!
Phoebe: Yeah!
(Ross wears the jackets and look at himself in the mirror)
Ross: Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there‚Äôs a sign on the back of the jacket, ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù) Boys will be boys?
Phoebe: What? They will be!
Ross: All right, that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm getting out of here.
Rachel: No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there‚Äôs other stuff. Here‚Äôs a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
Ross: Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Rachel: Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I‚Äôm... I‚Äôm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Ross: Really?
Rachel: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she‚Äôs gonna go nuts for you.
Ross: So, you‚Äôre saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Rachel: (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?

 [Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are still talking with Erica.]
Chandler: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife‚Äôs a reverend, that‚Äôs important to you?
Erica: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought ‚Äúwho better then a minister to raise a child!‚Äù
Monica: Amen.
Chandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Monica: Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands.
Erica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
Monica: It says ‚ÄúDo it!‚Äù. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Erica: Wow.
Chandler: Yeah, wow.
Erica: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
Monica: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
Erica: (to Chandler) Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
Chandler: No-ot for me it doesn‚Äôt.
(The agency guy enters the room)
Agency guy: So, how‚Äôs everything going in here?
Erica: We‚Äôre great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
Agency guy: Do you have any question for Erica?
Chandler: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
Agency guy: Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We‚Äôre very proud of it.
Chandler: You should be. You‚Äôre really on top of stuff..
Agency guy: (to Erica) Well, then if there‚Äôs nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Erica: Actually, I don‚Äôt think we have to.
Monica: We don‚Äôt?
Erica: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. (to the agency guy). I've made my decision. I choose them.
Monica: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?
Chandler: Yeah, I did.
Monica: (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!
 [Scene: Joey‚Äôs apartment. Rachel and Phoebe walk in, loaded with bags.]

Rachel: We got some really great stuff!
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Rachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me? 
Phoebe: Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Rachel: (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by  
  mistake, and one of mine is missing.
Phoebe: oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
¬†
 [Scene: Ross walks into Central Perk, wearing a pink and white ladies shirt. Joey is on the couch]
¬†
Ross: (to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
Joey: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Ross: (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Joey: (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Ross: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Joey: (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Ross: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!
¬† 
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's hotel room. They enter.]
Chandler: We are NOT signing those papers.
Monica: Why not?
Chandler: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Monica: God works in mysterious ways.
Chandler: You have gotta stop!
Monica: But she liked us.
Chandler: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Monica: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)
Chandler: Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
Monica: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Chandler: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Monica: (very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Chandler: I know..
Monica: I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
Chandler: oh, honey..
Monica: (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close.
Chandler: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. 

Monica: (realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug)
Chandler: So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
Monica: (sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Chandler: You're Jewish.
Monica: Technicality!

[Scene: A restaurant. Joey is on his date with Phoebe‚Äôs friend, Sarah. They are sitting opposite each other on a table for two. Their waiter approaches with two plates.]
Waiter: A garden salad for the lady (sets the plate down)
Joey: Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
Waiter: Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
Sarah: Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
Joey: oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)
Sarah: (looks over at Joey's platter) Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?
Joey: Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
(Sarah, is grinning and starts to reach over to Joey's plate to take a few clams)
Joey: How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarah‚Äôs fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)
Sarah: They are delicious (takes a few from the plate, puts one in her mouth and places the rest on her plate, then starts to reach over to Joey's platter again)
Joey: (Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that?
Sarah: Oh, that is so sweet..
Joey: Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)
(Then she reaches over again and Joey moves his plate a little to the left, and she misses, then she reaches out again, and he moves his plate to the right , so she misses again. She tries a third time and this time, Joey pushes his plate so far to the left, it drops off the edge of the table)
Joey: (Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!!
Sarah: What? what is the matter with you?
Joey: I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
Sarah: But you just said ""What's mine is yours""?
Joey: WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
Sarah: Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.
Joey: I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it). 
(Sarah looks a little disgusted)
¬†
[Scene: Ross and his date walk into a lobby. They are both wearing their jackets]
¬†
Girl: Wow, this place looks great.
Ross: Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Girl: Me too! (starts to take her coat off)
Ross: Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)
¬†
[Scene: Back at the restaurant with Joey and Sarah. Joey is holding Sarah's hands]
Joey: I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
Sarah: Sure (smiling) Just not as much as clams.
Joey: (Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams.
(The waiter arrives with their deserts)
Waiter: Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
Joey: Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
Waiter: Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
Joey: (More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to  
  be healthy. (pushes it aside)
Sarah: (tasting hers) Oh my God! (Looks at the waiter and then to Joey)
Joey: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
Waiter: Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
Sarah: Mmmm! Mmm!
(Sarah's beeper starts bleeping)
Sarah: Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
Joey: Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
(Joey's looking at Sarah's dessert, and takes her plate.)
Sarah: What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
Joey: Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule?
Sarah: (laughing) No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
Joey: (laughing) Really?
Sarah: Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. (puts her plate back at her side of the table)
Joey: Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room)
(Joey sits sideways on his chair, looking at Sarah's chocolate torte, and then looking away from it, nervously playing with his fork, drumming with it on the table every now and then.)
Joey: (to the torte) Stop staring at me!
(He then straightens himself, and looks at the torte)
Joey: Why, just a tiny little...
(He takes a little piece of Sarah's dessert. At first he doesn't think it's that special, but then...)
Joey: Oh-oh!
TIME LAPSE
(Sarah enters the room again, and stops when she sees her dessert is missing. Joey has emptied her plate, and has a chocolate covered mouth, just like a kid.)
Joey: I'm not even sorry.

[Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering.]
Erica: Hi!
Adoption Agency guy: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Agency guy: So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
Monica: (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?
Erica: Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler)
Monica: Look, doctor!
(Chandler takes Monica's hand, and gets serious) Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk...(pause) We're not who you think we are.
Agency guy: I don't understand.
Chandler: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
Erica: What?
Agency guy: That's impossible.
Chandler: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Agency guy: I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
Erica: So who are you?
Chandler: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Monica: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)
Erica: So you lied to me before?
Monica: Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend.
Erica: I can't believe this. 
Monica: But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Erica: Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
Monica: Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Erica: I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
(She leaves the room, but Chandler runs after her. They meet in the hallway.)
Chandler: Erica wait!
Erica: I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces)
Chandler: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Erica: Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
Chandler: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
Erica: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again)
Chandler: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
(They look at each other. We switch back to Monica. Chandler opens the door and she turns to look at him.)
Chandler: You still want that baby?
(Monica plays those words back in her mind and then smiles and runs to Chandler, who is twisting with joy. They hug.)
Monica: God bless you Chandler Bing!
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Central Perk. Joey's on the couch when Ross walks to him, with his jacket closed.]
Ross: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
Joey: (nods) So, why are you still wearing it?
Ross: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Joey: Ooh... Not so good.
Ross: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Joey: Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
(they shake hands the way friends would. There's a muffin on the table, and Ross breaks off a piece and wants to put it in his mouth.)
Joey: (shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
(Ross puts the piece back on the plate)

Monica: (really excited) Mmh... this cake is amazing!
Rachel: My God, get a room!
Monica: I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
Phoebe: If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
Monica: (with no hesitation) Sex!
Chandler: (looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!
Monica: Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""sex"" I wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""!
Chandler: (to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.
Phoebe: Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
Ross: Food.
Phoebe: Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Ross: Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Rachel: Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
Joey: Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
Rachel: No, you gotta pick one!

OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel and Phoebe are looking at some photos and they're sitting next to the window.]
Rachel: You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Phoebe: Oh, how cute!
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
Rachel: Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
Phoebe: Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! (looking outside the window) Look, there's Chandler. (he's on the street, talking to a woman)
Rachel: Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
Phoebe: OH! He's having an affair.
Rachel: He's not having an affair!
Phoebe: You know, I'm always right about these things.
Rachel: No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
Phoebe: Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
Rachel: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
Phoebe: Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler) 
Chandler: (picking up the phone) Hello.
Phoebe: Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Chandler: Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Phoebe: (shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Betrayal"", or... ""An Affair To Remember"".
Chandler: Those are all really old!
Phoebe: Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
Rachel: (whispering) ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" 
Phoebe: (glancing at her) What?
Rachel: They're in a caaar...
Phoebe: (to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. 
Rachel: Geez!
Phoebe: Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Rachel: Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
Phoebe: (patting her bag) I got them!

[Scene: Monica‚Äôs apartment. Chandler enters the door.]
Chandler: Hi!
Monica: Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes. 
Chandler: I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Monica: Nancy doesn‚Äôt smoke!
Chandler: Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
Monica: So? What do you think of the house?
Chandler: It‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs everything we‚Äôve been looking for.
Monica: Isn‚Äôt it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? 
Chandler: And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?
Monica: Don‚Äôt you love the huge yard?
Chandler: And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Monica: And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
Chandler: This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Monica: So? Do you think we should get it?
Chandler: I don‚Äôt know. What do you think?
Monica: I think we should.
Chandler: I do too.
Monica: This is huge!
Chandler: I know.
Monica: How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
Chandler: I don‚Äôt know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy‚Äôs car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
Monica: Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Chandler: We don‚Äôt. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
Monica: Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Chandler: I know. Gooooood luck with it.
¬†
[Scene: Joey‚Äôs apartment. Everybody except Monica and Chandler is there.]
Ross: I just can‚Äôt see Chandler cheating!
Rachel: I‚Äôm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
Joey: Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can‚Äôt believe he would do this to Monica!
Ross: I know, and with the baby coming?
Phoebe: So, should we tell her?
Ross: I don‚Äôt know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
Phoebe: Why? Who‚Äôd you seen him with?
Ross: No one, I‚Äôm just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)
Phoebe: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Ross: (yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike‚Äôs a great guy, it was hypothetical!
Phoebe: All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You‚Äôre right, he wouldn‚Äôt cheat.
Ross: Believe me, if I did see with someone, there‚Äôs no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)
Phoebe : WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
¬†
[Scene: Monica‚Äôs apartment. Monica is cleaning with a vacuum and then she cleans it with a dust buster. The guys enter the room.]
Rachel: Oh, look at her, so happy!
Monica: If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Joey: Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
Monica: No, he‚Äôs picking up dinner, why, what‚Äôs up?
Phoebe: Well, look, whatever happens, we‚Äôre here for you and we love you.
Monica (puzzled): All right...
Ross: We think Chandler might be having an affair.
Monica: What?
Rachel: Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
Phoebe: They went in together. So sorry.
Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God that‚Äôs awful! What did you think of the house?
(they all look confused and sorry for her)
Phoebe: What?
Joey: (walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
Monica: Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: (to Chandler) You son of a bitch!
Chandler: Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Monica: (goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Rachel: Who's Nancy?
Ross: What's going on?
Monica: (turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Chandler: Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Joey: I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
Phoebe: Why do you have a realtor?
Monica: Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
Joey: (clearly shocked) What?
Rachel: Are you serious?
Monica: When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Phoebe: So you're gonna move?
Ross: Oh my God.
Joey: Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
Rachel: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
Monica: And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
Chandler: ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Ross: (sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
Phoebe: Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
Ross: You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
Joey: No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)
Ross: (to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
(pause before Monica and Chandler speak, they look like they are looking for the right words)
Chandler: Actually, we already found a house we love.
Ross: What?
Monica: And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
(All the friends looked shocked and confused. There is a long silence.)
Chandler: Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
TIME LAPSE
Ross: You put an offer on a house? 
Monica: (smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)
Phoebe: Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
Chandler: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Joey: Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can! 
Chandler: (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)
Monica: We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?
Rachel: Yeah it is.
Joey: What the hell are you doin'?
Rachel: Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
Phoebe: Yeah, but so is this.
Ross: Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
¬†
[We fade to some flashback scenes.]
(from 1.01 - ""The One Where Monica Gets a New Roommate - The Pilot"")
Rachel: (talking on the phone) C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.
Rachel: Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. 
Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...

(from 1.18 - ""The One With All the Poker"")
Ross: That money is mine, Green!

Phoebe: Hey, it‚Äôs your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
The Guys: We will. (they don‚Äôt move)
Monica: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
Rachel: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. 
(Rachel sticks a marshmallow into Monica‚Äôs nose. Monica takes it out of her nose by closing one nostril, and blowing.)
Monica: Every year.
¬†
(from 5.08 - ""The One With the Thanksgiving Flashbacks"")
Joey: (he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!
Phoebe: (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Joey: I put it on to scare Chandler!
Phoebe: Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Joey: It smells really bad in here.
Phoebe: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
(They hear Monica trying to unlock the door. So Phoebe quickly pushes his head down onto the table to make it look like the turkey is just sitting on a platter and not stuck on Joey's head.)
Monica: Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
Joey: It's Joey.
¬†
(from 4.12 - ""The one With the Embryos"")
Monica: I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Rachel: Oooohh that‚Äôs interesting.
Chandler: If you win, we give up the birds.
Joey: (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
Chandler: But if we win, we get your apartment.
Joey: Oooooh!
Monica: Deal!

Monica: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
TIME LAPSE
(The door opens and Joey and Chandler ride in on the big, fake dog in triumph)
Rachel: Y‚Äôknow what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Joey: Hey, don‚Äôt get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Rachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Monica: Hey, we would still be living here if hadn‚Äôt gotten the question wrong!
Rachel: Well it stupid, unfair question!
Ross: Don‚Äôt blame the questions!
Chandler: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
¬†
(from 5.15 - ""The One With The Girl Who Hits Joey"")
Ross: Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Chandler: (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
Monica: (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
(Ross spots Chandler and starts chasing him around the kitchen table. Chandler runs and hides behind Monica.)
Ross: What the hell are doing?!!
Rachel: (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Chandler: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Joey: (panicking) Dude! He's right there!
Ross: (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Chandler: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Monica: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
(There's a brief pause.)
Ross: (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) 
¬†
(from 6.06 - ""The One On The Last Night"")
Monica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I‚Äôm just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?""
Rachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Phoebe: Ok, you guys, I don‚Äôt mean to make things worse, but umm, I don‚Äôt want to live with Rachel anymore.
Monica and Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: You‚Äôre just so mean to each other! And I don‚Äôt want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Rachel: Well, Phoebe that‚Äôs fine because I‚Äôm not moving.
Monica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y‚Äôknow, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y‚Äôknow Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she‚Äôll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I‚Äôd like.
Phoebe: What else?
Monica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Rachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Phoebe: That‚Äôs nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Monica: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Rachel: Well y‚Äôknow, I don‚Äôt want you to be cold.
Monica: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
TIME LAPSE
(Monica closes the door and slowly walks into Rachel‚Äôs old and now empty room.)
Chandler: (entering) Hey.
Monica: She really left.
Chandler: I know. (He kisses her.)
Monica: Thank you.
Chandler: No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
Monica: Can I ask you a question?
Chandler: Sure!
Monica: What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
¬†
(from 1.09 - ""The One Where Underdog Gets Away"")
Chandler: Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
All: That's so sweet.
Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Rachel: And a crappy New Year.
Chandler: Here, here!
¬†
[Scene: We're back to the present. Chandler and Monica's. They're all still at the kitchen table.]
Rachel: You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Joey: Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong. 
Phoebe: Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
Ross: You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)
Rachel: Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.
(The phone rings and Chandler goes to get it)
Chandler: Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
Monica: And?
(Chandler listens to what Nancy says)
Chandler: (to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
Monica: We can't afford that.
Chandler: I know.
Monica: Well, there you go.
(Chandler and Monica hug)
Joey: I'm really sorry you guys.
Ross: Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Rachel: Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
Phoebe: (to Monica) You're gonna be okay?
Monica: Yeah, we'll be okay.
Ross: Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)
Joey: You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
Chandler: That's okay, we understand.
Joey: And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
(Chandler gives Joey her business card, which he eagerly grabs and he leaves.)
Monica: I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
Chandler: Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
Monica: What?
Chandler: We got the house.
Monica: Oh my God!
Chandler: I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Monica: Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
Chandler: We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.
Monica: And a baby...
Chandler: We're growing up.
Monica: We sure are.
Chandler: So who's gonna tell them?
Monica: (quickly) Not it!
Chandler: Not it! Damn it!
COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Central Perk. The entire gang is there, and Chandler and Monica are handing out presents.]
Monica: Rachel, this is yours.
Rachel: Aah! Why? What are these for?
Chandler: You'll see.

(they all tear off the wrapping paper)
Rachel: Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)
Phoebe: Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. (she got earrings)
Monica: I know.
Ross: I love this. (he got a sweater)
Joey: A meatball Sub? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)
Ross: Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
Chandler: Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
Monica: Enjoy!
(they both run off, leaving Ross, Phoebe and Rachel stunned.)
Joey: (speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) What did they say?

Monica: Hey, let me tell them!
Joey: Sure.
Monica: Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Phoebe: Great!
Ross: Really? Which one?
Monica: (stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
Ross: Things you find in the ocean, (to Joey) You're gonna be on ""Pyramid""!!
Monica: Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
Ross: Except for ""Match game""...
Monica: Or ""Win, Lose or Draw"".
Chandler: What did I marry into?
Joey: Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
Monica: Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Phoebe: Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Ross: Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Joey: Seriously?
Ross: (very excited) Yeah-uh!
Monica: Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Chandler: You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Monica: Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
Rachel: Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Monica: (singing) ""I'm a little bit country""...
Ross: (singing) ""...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll""!
Chandler: (to Monica) I'm leaving you.

OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Class of '91 reunion. Ross and Chandler enter.]
Ross: So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.
Chandler: Who?
Ross: He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Chandler: (looking around) Did I go to this school?
Ross: Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
Chandler: (looks over at her) Sure, nice.
Ross: Dude. You're married to my sister. 
Chandler: You're right, by saying ""nice"" I'm virtually licking her.
Ross: Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
Chandler: Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Ross: Yes please.
¬†
[Flashback, year 1987. Chandler enters the school's corridor. Ross is hanging some flyers on the wall. Both have a funny 80s hair and clothes.]
Ross: Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
Chandler: Awesome, the name really stands out.
Ross: Thanks to a little something called ""Helvetica Bold 24 point""!
Chandler: Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Missy: Hey guys!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: Hey, Missy...
Chandler: You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Ross: Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called ""Way! No Way!"".
Missy: No way!
Chandler and Ross: Way!
Missy: Right. I'll be there. (she leaves)
Chandler: Fresh!
Ross: Boss!
Chandler: Mint!
Ross: She's gone.
Chandler: I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Ross: Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
Chandler: I said it first, bro.
Ross: Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
Chandler: (angrily) Look, if you did...
Ross: Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
Chandler: Totally. I had sex in High school...
Ross: Me too. I'm good at it.
Chandler: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
Ross: You got it.
Chandler: All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
Ross: Those are the pacts!
Chandler: Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Ross: Oh, oh... maybe not you!
¬†
[We get back to the Class of '91 reunion, where Ross and Chandler are still looking at Missy.]
Chandler: Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Ross: Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Chandler: Your hands are shaking.
Ross: I know, and I can't stop sweating. (he walks towards Missy)

Voice: Five! Four! Three! Applause!
Donny Osmond: Yeah! Welcome, it is Soap Opera week here on Pyramid, let's meet our contestants. First, Gene Lester is a database specialist, he's gonna be playing with ""Days of Our Life's"" star Joey Tribbiani! (Joey's amazed at the place and he keeps looking around till he realizes the audience is applauding him)
Joey: (to Gene) I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! (pause) Only better looking and richer.
Donny: ...should be playing with the star of ""General Hospital"" Leslie Charleson. (applause) Welcome everybody. Good luck to all of you. Let's play Pyramid. All right? Now... we flipped a coin before the show, Gene, you won the toss, so you're gonna start. Which category would you like?
Gene: I'll take ""You crossed the line"".
Donny: You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!
Joey: (on the screen there's the word ""Supermarket"") Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn't have said 'supermarket'. The next word appears, ""notebook"") Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
Gene: Diary.
Joey: Noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... Damn it! (next word appears: ""blueprint"") Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey... (the last word is ""Football field"" and there are 5 seconds left) In high school, I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...
Gene: Cafeteria.
Joey: Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. (time's finished) OOOH!

[Scene: Monica's apartment, where Phoebe's bachelorette party is taking place.]
Phoebe: (to Rachel) Thank you so much for this.
Rachel: Oh, d'you like it? 
Phoebe: Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
Rachel: Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
Phoebe: Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks her tea) Hmmmm... raunchy!
Rachel: Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Phoebe: Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea? 
Rachel: Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
¬†
[Scene: Joey's at the game show ""Pyramid"" with host Donny Osmond.]
Donny: Now Gene I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game, all right? Describe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator.
Joey: Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
Donny: Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!
(the first word is cream)
Gene: You put this in your coffee.
Joey: A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
Gene: It's white!
Joey: Paper, snow, a ghost! 
Gene: It's heavier then milk!
Joey: A rock, a dog, the earth.
Gene: Pass! 
(the second word is mayonnaise)

(The fourth word is soda)
Joey: Relish!
Gene: Stop!
Joey: Oh.
Donny: Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there...
Joey: Yeah...
Donny: Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.
Stage Manager : And we're out!
Joey: Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
Gene: Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!
Joey: Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
Gene: Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you.
Joey: Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? (pause). Yeah!
¬†
[Scene: College reunion party. Ross is talking to Missy.]
Ross: So, Saturday night!
Missy: I'd love to!
Ross: Great!
Missy: So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Ross: Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
Missy: Sure, he was in your ""band""? (she air quotes band)
Ross: It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Missy: Sorry.
Ross: That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Missy: Really?
Ross: Yeah, why?
Missy: Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
Ross: You did?
Missy: Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
Ross: (angrily) AND ON MY TURF?
¬†
[Scene: Monica's apartment. The bachelorette party.]
Monica: (to Rachel) Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
Rachel: Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
(someone knocks at the door)
Monica: Who is it?
Man: It's the police!
Rachel: (pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!
Phoebe: (Excited, running back to her seat) Oh!
Man: That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
Monica: What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)
Roy, the male stripper: (coughs) Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!

COMMERCIAL BREAK

Roy: Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
Monica: Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
Roy: Goodbody!
Monica: ...If-you-say-so. 
Roy: So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take (he shakes his hips) downtown! (Monica points Phoebe)
Phoebe: Oh, God!
Roy: All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! (he thrusts his pelvis towards Phoebe) Whaaaa... (walks back to plug in his cd player) Here? All right.
Phoebe: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah?
Phoebe: Are you kidding?
Rachel: All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
Phoebe: How old is your phonebook?
Monica: Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
Phoebe: Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
Roy: Are you talking about me?
Monica: Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
Roy: Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? (pause) Did someone call for the long arm of the law? (He extends his arm from around his crotch and then upward and outward, towards Phoebe) I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! (Puts his hands over his crotch) I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
(he uses his remote to turn on the music, ""Tainted Love"" by Soft Cell, and starts dancing for Phoebe. He shakes his butt, moves his shoulders back, grabs his crotch and hops towards Phoebe. Phoebe is half horrified and half scared. He takes his hat off and throws it away, does some ""Can Can"" high kicks and swings his butt in front of Phoebe who looks at it in disgust. Then he tears open his shirt and shows her his chest and she flinches.)
Roy: Whoa, whoa, whoa (he turn off the music). She cringed!
Phoebe: This is how I look when I'm turned on!
Roy: You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? (goes to get it) Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
Phoebe: Shocking!
Roy: Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
Phoebe: Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
Rachel: No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
Phoebe: No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
Roy: Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time! 
Phoebe: I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
Roy: Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
Phoebe: Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)
Roy: I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath (points at his groin)... is all man.
Phoebe: I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
Roy: (making a crying face) Oh, you're mean!
Monica: (walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
Roy: Damnit. OH! (To Phoebe) Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
¬†
[Scene: At Pyramid. Joey is with the woman now.]
Donny: Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.
Joey: (To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)
Donny: Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. (Joey goes form looking very confident to looking very shocked the instant the word congress is said) Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!
(Camera goes to Joey. The clock is at 20 sec. The word ""Legislature"" appears. He looks at it blank faced and his eyes shift between Henrietta and his screen)
Joey: Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (Next word: ""Rotunda"") Pass. (Next word: ""Filibuster"" stares at it a moment) Pass. (Henrietta is looking very confused) (Next word: ""Addendum"" 4 seconds remaining) Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
Henrietta: Uvula!
Joey: Oh, then pass. (Next word: ""Joint session"", but time's up, Joey acts very disappointed)
Donny: O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! (Gene is clapping his hands looking very happy and so is Joey) And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani (Both of their smiles fade away instantly)
¬†
[Scene: Class of '91 reunion. Ross is walking angrily towards Chandler, who is talking to two other guys.]
Ross: (To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
(Chandler looks at the other two guys, embarrassed)
Chandler: (to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Ross: You broke the pact! 
Chandler: Ross, that was 16 years ago!
Ross: That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
Chandler: I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
Ross: I didn't.
Chandler: Oh really?
Ross: No.
Chandler: Oh really!?
Ross: NO!
Chandler: ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)
Adrienne: Yes?
Chandler and Ross: Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)
Ross: I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Chandler: Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
Ross: I don't know what... you're talking about.
Chandler: Really?
¬†
[Flashback scene: 80's College party.] 
 Present Chandler's voice: Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
(An 80's Rachel and fat Monica walk into the party room. Both with funny hair-do's and clothes)
Monica: I can't believe we are at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!
Rachel: This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
Monica: Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
Rachel: I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)
Monica: Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
Rachel: It... You can so totally tell. 
Monica: I KNOW!
Rachel: Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).
Chandler: Aren't you...?
Rachel: Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).
Chandler: (smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing? 
Rachel: Bitchin'
Chandler: Hi Monica.
Monica: Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)
Chandler: O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)
Monica: Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Rachel: Oh.
Monica: Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
(Cut to Chandler. He's walking around looking for Ross. He sees him kissing a girl next to a vending machine)
Ross: Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Adrienne: Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
Ross: Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)
¬†
[Scene: We cut back to the present. The reunion where Chandler and Ross are talking.] 
Ross: I didn't know you knew about that.
Chandler: Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song: ""Betrayal In The Common Room"".
Ross: (looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm sorry.
Chandler: Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Ross: So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
Chandler: (smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
Ross: We are even, right?
Chandler: (sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
Ross: (thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?
Chandler: Not her!
¬†
[Flashback scene: We cut back to the 80's party. Rachel and Monica are ""dancing"".]
Rachel: I am sooo drunk.
Monica: That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)
Chandler: Soo... you girls having fun?
Monica: For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)
Pizza guy: SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
Monica: Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy)
Rachel: (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow. 
Chandler: Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
Chandler: Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
Rachel: (blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers ""Oh my God!"")
Chandler: So where are you applying to? 
Rachel: Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!
Chandler: I'm in college and I'm in a band. 
Rachel: (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
¬† 
[Scene: Monica's apartment. The stripper is sitting at the kitchen table. Monica, Rachel and Phoebe are standing around him]
Roy: What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
Phoebe: You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
Roy: No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
Rachel: No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
Roy: I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
Rachel: So maybe something in an office.
Phoebe: Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
Roy: You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.
Phoebe: There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
Roy: Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
Phoebe: (after a pause) Finish it!
Roy: What?
Phoebe: Your last dance. Do it for us.
Roy: Really?
Rachel: (to Phoebe) Really?
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time. 
Roy: Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!
(they sit down and Roy plays ""You Make Me Feel"" by Sylvester on his boom box, and starts... With his back towards the girls, he starts waving his hands, then backs towards the girls slapping his butt, then swings it around, and makes thrusting pelvic movements in front of Phoebe. He dances around the tables in between all the girls, and gets back into the kitchen part of the room. He then tears off one of his sleeves and throws it towards Monica and Rachel, who fight over who gets it. He then tears off his other sleeve and moves it back and forth between his legs, getting closer to Phoebe.)
Phoebe: Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
(Roy then sits on Phoebe's lap, looking exhausted)
Phoebe: Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
Roy: (out of breath) Have to...

[Scene: The game show studio. Joey and Gene are sitting in the winner circle.]
Donny: Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?
Joey: (nervously) Yeah...
Gene: (irritable) Sure. (Joey gets even more nervous)
Donny: Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO! (runs off)
(the screen says ""6 to win"" and ""types of trees"")
Gene: Oak, maple, elm, birch...
Joey: I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
(Joey hears the bell which means his answer is correct and is surprised. The screen now says ""5 to win"" and ""Spanish words"")
Gene: Uhm... Buenos d√≠as, enchilada, por favor...
Joey: (sympathetic) Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
(There's the next bell, and the correct answer. The screen changes to ""4 to win"" and ""things that burn"". Gene now realizes that he got two correct answers and gets up in his seat.)
Gene: A match, a candle...
Joey: Things that go ""tssst"" when you put them out.
Gene: A torch, a bonfire... (Joey seems lost) uhm, your pee...
Joey: Things that burn.
(and another bell for the correct answer. ""3 to win"" and ""What a dog might say"")
Gene: ""I'd like to go for a walk"", uhm ""scratch my belly"".
Joey: Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
Gene: Uhm, ""I have fur"", ""I like to bark"".
Joey: Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
(the bell sounds again, ""2 to win"" and ""pizza toppings"")
Gene: Pepperoni...
Joey: (instantly) Pizza toppings, next!
(there's 10 seconds left, ""1 to win"" and ""Supermodels"")
Gene: Cindy Crawford, Christie Brinkley, Heidi Klum, Claudia Schiffer...
Joey: Oh, oh, oh... (5 seconds left)
Gene: Christie Turlington, Kate Moss...
Joey: Girls Chandler could never get?
Gene: (irritated) Supermodels!
Joey: Where? (looking around)

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's there and Ross and Chandler walk in.]
Ross: Hey, where's Rachel?
Monica: She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Ross: Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Monica: What? When was this?
Ross: Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Monica: Oh my God! That's wild!
Chandler: Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Ross: Well, it matters to me.
Chandler: Why?
Ross: Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Chandler: You kissed her that night too?
Monica: Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
Chandler: Seriously, where did this happen?
Ross: Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Chandler: Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Ross: Mine.
Chandler: I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Ross: No, she was definitely on my bed. 
Chandler: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Ross: Well, then who was on my bed?
Monica: (screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)
Ross: (realizing) NO! No, no!
Monica: YES! (Chandler gets an ""oh no!"" look on his face)
Ross: You were under the pile of coats?
Monica: I was the pile of coats!
Ross: OH MY GOD!
Monica: You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Ross: You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Monica: You were my first kiss ever?
Chandler: What did I marry into?

COMMERCIAL BREAK
¬†
[Scene: Back at the party in 1987. People are dancing to ""Disco Inferno"" by The Trammps.]
(Monica is dancing. At first she seems insecure and moves slowly, but then gets into the groove and swings her hips from side to side while holding her hands up. She then eats the last piece of pizza she was holding and again moves her hips from side to side, pushing her hands in the air in beat with the music. Her moves get more wildly while she's snapping her fingers. She loses balance and falls back onto a pink bean bag.)
Monica: Oh, crap!

[Scene: Central Perk. Joey's sitting on the couch and Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe: Oh, hey Joey.
Joey: Uh, hey.
Phoebe: Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
Joey: (afraid) Yeah.
Phoebe: Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
Joey: So he can't come?
Phoebe: No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
Joey: Seriously? 
Phoebe: Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
Joey: I am pretty wisdomous.
Phoebe: So... what do you say?
Joey: Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored. (they hug)
Phoebe: Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Joey: (takes her hand) Listen, I hope... that you know... (has difficulty saying it) I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!

OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch. A waitress brings a coffee and Phoebe wants to pay.]
Phoebe: Oh.
Joey: Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Phoebe: (her mobile phone rings) Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! (she answers) Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me! 
Monica: (she enters with a headset on and she's speaking into the microphone) Well, it matters to me!
Phoebe: Well, I don't care, so you pick!
Monica: Did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Phoebe: Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
Monica: You don't know military time?
Phoebe: Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Monica: Just subtract twelve.
Phoebe: Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
Monica: (screaming) Six o'clock!
Phoebe: Ok.
Monica: Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Phoebe: Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Monica: Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Phoebe: What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
Monica: Ooh... she backed out.
Phoebe: She did? Why?
Monica: I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding"". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
Phoebe: (looking angry) Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
¬†
[Scene: The wedding rehearsal dinner.] 
Chandler: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Chandler: You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them. 
Phoebe: Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
Chandler: No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Phoebe: Rehearse it!
Ross: Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)
Mike: Thanks for coming you guys.
Ross: Oh, (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him) hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
Mike: Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
Ross: That is why!
Mike: Yeah.
Phoebe: So Rach.
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: Where is Emma?
Rachel: Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Monica: (coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)
Joey: Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
Mike's mother: Yes, we are.
Joey: Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
Mike's father: How's that?
Joey: You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
Mike's father: Who in God's name are you?
Joey: Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
(cut to Ross, Chandler and Rachel)
Chandler: (to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Ross: Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
Rachel: Uh... November?
Ross: I wanna say it's not looking good.
Rachel: Hey Pheebs...
Phoebe: What's up?
Rachel: Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Chandler: Heh.
Phoebe: Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
Ross: What? (Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)
Rachel: Well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh, and I can leave!
Phoebe: I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
Ross: Oh, man!
Chandler: This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!
Ross: FOOTBALL!
Chandler: Thank you.
Monica: (looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
Phoebe: Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
Monica: Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
Phoebe: I don't have a fax machine.
Monica: Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
Ross: I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Chandler: I know, I hate being left out of things.
Ross: And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Mike: Hey guys, how is it going?
Chandler: Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Mike: Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
Chandler: What happened?
Ross: Who cares, AND?
Mike: ...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... (Ross stands up) 
Ross: I'll do it!
Chandler: (standing up too) M-Me-me-me!
Mike: You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
Chandler: Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
Ross: No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?
Mike: You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. (he leaves)
Ross: (to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Chandler: Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Ross: Please, you're going down!
Chandler: You are going downer!
Ross: Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Chandler: (almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)
¬†
[Scene: Wedding rehearsal dinner. Joey and Mike are talking.]
Joey: So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
Mike: Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
Joey: Oh, hey, my pleasure. (he suddenly becomes very serious) So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
Mike: I intend to marry her.
Joey: Oh, a wiseacre. (Mike looks bewildered). No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
Mike: No more so than acting.
Joey: Strike two!
Mike: You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
Joey: Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
(Cut to Chandler and Ross. Phoebe comes out of the ladies room and they run toward her.)
Ross: So, what did you decide?
Phoebe: I decided to pee.
Chandler: Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Phoebe: Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
Chandler: Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Phoebe: Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking by). Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
Rachel: (excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody, what is it!
Phoebe: Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
Rachel: What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
Phoebe: All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
Ross: I'll do it! (Monica approaches)
Monica: Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)
Mike: Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
Monica: You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
Mike: Is that what you say to Chandler?
Monica: (very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)
Phoebe: Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
Monica (rolling her eyes): oh God.
Phoebe: And... moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: YOU'RE FIRED! (mimes the CUT again) (pause and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)

[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey's having breakfast; Phoebe enters the room carrying her wedding dress.]
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Happy wedding day!
Phoebe: Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
Rachel: Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
Joey: Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages! 
(Monica enters the room)
Monica: Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Phoebe: Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
Monica: Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)
Phoebe: Wow, this is a lot!
Monica: Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Phoebe: You won awards?
Monica: Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
(Ross enters the room)
Ross: Hey!
Monica: Hi.
Ross: Where's Rach?
Monica: She's in her room, why?
Ross: I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachel's room, knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) Oh! My God! You're breathtaking! 
Rachel: What d'you want?
Ross: You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Rachel: Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
Ross: I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Rachel: Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
Ross: Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
Rachel: Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
Ross: (waving his fist in the air in triumph) YES, YES!
¬†
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Phoebe is talking at the phone, Monica is listening amused.]
Phoebe: Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins? 
Monica: I know.
(Mike enters the room).
Mike: Hey.
Phoebe: Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be?
Mike: (thinks a moment) Orchids?
Phoebe: Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
(Joey comes out from his room)
Joey: (to Mike) Hello Michael.
Mike: Joseph.
Joey: May I have a word with you, please?
Mike: (looking around the room) This is... great...
Joey: Have a seat. (Mike sits on his bed, and Joey towers over him. He starts talking in an Italian godfather-type voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) I cannot allow this. 
Mike: (not amused) Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
Joey: More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."" 
Mike: Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
Joey: I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
Mike: (gets up) Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her. 
Joey: (very satisfied and smiling) That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family. 
Mike: That must have been one lousy movie.
Joey: (almost crying) That was ME!
¬†
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is pacing and Rachel walks in.]
Rachel: Hi
Chandler: Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Rachel: Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Chandler: Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back. 
Rachel: All right fine, I pick you.
Chandler: (Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make ""groom"" for Chandler.
Rachel: (not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...
¬†
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe is on the phone and Monica is nonchalantly ""minding her own business"".]
Phoebe: No! We're gonna do it my way. (listens) Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. (switches calls) Hello? 
(Mike and Joey come out of Joey's room)
Joey: I'm glad we had this little talk.
Mike: Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. (walks away) That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?
Phoebe: Okay.
Monica: Bye.
(Mike opens the door and there is a gigantic ice sculpture standing in the doorway)
Mike: Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall? 
Phoebe: Oh my God, what's it doing here? 
Monica: (Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling) Uh! What a pickle.
Phoebe: (starting to panic) Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me? 
Joey: (staring at the ice sculpture) How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (They all glare at him)
¬†
[Scene: Central Perk. Ross is getting coffee at the counter. Chandler walks in.]
Chandler: How's it going? 
Ross: (smiling to himself) Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Chandler: (smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.
Ross: (barely containing himself at this point) Well, you have fun tonight.
Chandler: You too. 
Ross: Oh, I will.
Chandler: Me too.
(They walk passed each other, Ross towards the door, Chandler towards the counter, suddenly they turn around to face each other)
Ross: Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you? 
Chandler: I'm not supposed to tell you. 
Ross: I'm not supposed to tell you!
(Cut to Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Ross storm in looking very unhappy)
Chandler: You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)
Rachel: Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Ross: Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again. (he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)
Chandler: Rach, Rach, knock knock.
Rachel: Who's there?
Chandler: I'll tell you at the wedding.
Rachel: Uh.
(Mike walks in.)
Mike: Hey, I forgot my scarf. 
Rachel: You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick. 
Mike: Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy. 
Ross: What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose. 
(all eyes turn to Rachel) 
Rachel: (sarcastic) Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
(Ross and Chandler look shocked)
(Cut to Phoebe who is in the living room, still on the phone.)
Phoebe: Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!? 
Monica: (enjoying what she's seeing) How's it going? 
Phoebe: (to Monica) Help me.
Monica: What? 
Phoebe: I want you to be Crazy Bitch again. 
Monica: (Sounds moved) Really? 
Phoebe: (Nearly in tears) Please? 
Monica: You really want me to come back?
Phoebe: More than I wanna get married.
Monica: Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
(Joey walks in) 
Joey: Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
Phoebe: (sounds scared already) About what?
Joey: The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. (Opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)
Monica: Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
Joey: I don't think they are.
Ross: (to Rachel) Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry Pheebs. 
¬†
[Scene: Monica's apartment. They are all sitting around.]
Monica: (Putting down her phone) Well, the club lost it's power.
Joey: Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
Rachel: Since when do you watch the news? 
Joey: Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
Ross: (To Phoebe and Mike) I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
Phoebe: I know.
Rachel: Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
Phoebe: What? 
Rachel: Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
Phoebe: (Turning to Mike) What do you think? 
Mike: I think I wanna get married to you today. 
Phoebe: Me too! (turning to Monica) Monica, do you think we could do it?
Monica: (thinking) AFFIRMATIVE!
¬†
[Scene: Outside. They are a bunch of people arranging chairs, shoveling snow and making other preparations.]
Monica: (walking around with her headset still on) OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. (He does so and the lights above the chairs light up. Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)
Mike's mom: Michael!
Mike: Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! (kisses his dad) Hi! (kisses his mom) Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...
Mike's mom: No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever. 
Mike's dad: (leans in towards Mike) I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... (to his wife) Come on, sweetheart.
Mike: (to Chandler and Ross) You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
Chandler: So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
Mike: I guess.
Chandler and Ross: I'll do it!
Ross: No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
Chandler: I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
Ross: (takes Chappy from Mike) Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!
Monica: Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
Mike: Oh, no! 
Joey: Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
Monica: Really?
Joey: Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
Ross: Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
Joey: I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
Monica: Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
Chandler: (quickly) I'll do it.
Ross: I'll...
Chandler: (to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) Ah ah...
Monica: Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me. (they walk off, Ross looks down to Chappy, who he's holding and he gets a whiff of the dog's smell. He is clearly disgusted by it.)
(Cut to inside Central Perk where Rachel is helping Phoebe. Chandler and Monica enter.)
Monica: Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
Phoebe: Oh, okay. Hi new dad. (Chandler waves)
Monica: So, you're ready to do this?
Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
Rachel: Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)
Phoebe: Oh, thank you.
Monica: I love you. (Phoebe leans in to kiss her.) Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell. (the girls hug)
Phoebe: I love you guys.
Rachel and Monica: I love you.
Monica: Okay. (in her microphone) It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. (to all) Let's get this bad boy on the road.
Chandler: (to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Monica: (checking her clipboard) I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Chandler: Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)
Monica: Okay Marjorie, hit it.
(A woman with a steel drum and a guy with a xylophone start playing an instrumental version of ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" by Elvis Presley. A bridesmaid and a groomsman walk down the isle. Next are Rachel and Ross, who carries Chappy in his arms.)
Rachel: Geez Ross, you could have showered.
Ross: It's the dog.
(we cut to Monica)
Monica: Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh, that's me.
(She walks down the aisle with the groomsman. We cut to inside Central Perk, where Phoebe and Chandler are waiting.)
Chandler: Ready?
Phoebe: (nervously) Okay.
Chandler: Okay.
Phoebe: Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
(She takes off the coat she was wearing over her wedding dress, which is violet and has a darker shade petticoat underneath which shows at one side where the dress is lifted up to about the height of her hip and connected to the petticoat. She's wearing a veil over her curly hair and  a low cut top with straps only just hanging over her shoulders.)
Chandler: Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
Phoebe: I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
Chandler: You look beautiful.
Phoebe: Thank you.
(They start to leave Central Perk. The band starts to play ""Here, There and Everywhere"" by the Beatles. The crowd rises from their seats. Phoebe and Chandler walk down the aisle. Phoebe really glows with happiness. So does Mike who watches her walk down the isle. When Phoebe and Chandler arrive, they kiss and Phoebe walks to her bridesmaids.)
Mike: My God! Aren't you freezing?
Phoebe: Na-ah.
(the music ends)
Joey: Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
(one of the groomsmen gives the rings to Joey)
Joey: (whispering to Phoebe) Okay...
Phoebe: When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts the ring on Mikes finger)
Mike: Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever. (He puts the ring on Phoebe's finger.)
Phoebe: Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
Mike: I love you too. 
Ross: Uh Joey...
Joey: Yeah?
Ross: Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Joey: Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
Phoebe: I do.
(Joey has a ""Yeah you do"" smile on his face)
Joey: Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
Mike: I do.
Joey: I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
(Phoebe and Mike kiss)
Phoebe: I got married! (everyone applauds) Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
(Mike takes off his coat to give to Phoebe and the steel band plays ""The Wedding Song"")

COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler and Joey are walking up the stairs.]
Chandler: That really was an incredible wedding.
Joey: It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
Chandler: I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
Joey: Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
Chandler: I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
(cut to the street in front of Central Perk where Ross is walking Chappy. He has a plastic bag in his hand.)
Ross: Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.

Ross: Joey, you shouldn't lie on your r√©sum√©.
Monica: Yeah, you really shouldn't. (to Ross, sarcastically) By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Ross: (whispering) It was ok...
Rachel: I did not know you spoke French.
Phoebe: Oui, bien sur je parle Fran√ßais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
Rachel: Oh... you're so sexy!

OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.]
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Chandler: Why are you wearing my apron?
Monica: I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Chandler: Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as ""my wife"" and ""the woman who's carrying my child""? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?
Ross: (he enters) Hey. 
Monica: Hey.
Ross: You guys know where Rachel is? 
Monica: No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
Ross: So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)
Monica: Hey!
Ross: Hey! 
Monica: These are for Erica! 
Ross: What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Monica: Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
Ross: So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Monica: Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
Chandler: Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""Mooooo""!
Monica: Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Ross: (looking at Rachel entering with Emma) Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Rachel: Ross...
Ross: No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Rachel: My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while I was at Barney‚Äôs. 
Ross: Oh my God.
Monica: Honey.
Chandler: I'm so sorry...
Ross: Is-is he ok?
Rachel: Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
Ross: Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
Rachel: No, come on, I'm totally ok. (hugging him) I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
Ross: Still-still, let me come... for me.
Rachel: Ok. If you really need to.
Ross: I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Rachel: Oh, I really could.
Ross: Oh!
Rachel: Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
¬†
[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe's trying to teach Joey French, so she's sitting in front of him with the script in her hands.]
Phoebe: All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is ""My name is Claude"", so, just repeat after me. ""Je m'appelle Claude"".
Joey: Je de coup Clow.
Phoebe: Well, just... let's try it again.
Joey: Ok. 
Phoebe: Je m'appelle Claude.
Joey: Je depli mblue.
Phoebe: Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying. 
Joey: Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
Phoebe: It does, really?
Joey: Yeah.

Monica: Joey. Erica, baby!
Joey: Hi.
Monica: Everyone. Erica, baby!
Chandler: Monica. Calm, self.
Erica: Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!
Joey: Welcome to New York City! Or should I say ""ghe deu flooff New York City""?
Chandler: Why would you say that?
Phoebe: Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
Erica: I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
Joey: Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
Erica: Oh yeah, let's do that!
Chandler: Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.
¬†
[Scene: Hospital.]
Rachel: (stopping a nurse who's coming out of a room) Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
Ross: And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Rachel: Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
Rachel: Can somebody please go in?
Nurse: Absolutely.
Ross: Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Rachel: Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
Ross: I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
Nurse: He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
Ross: I'm feeling better.
Rachel: Oh! (They enter. Rachel sees his father, lying on a bed, with tubes, drip and everything) Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
Nurse: Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
Rachel: Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Ross: He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Rachel (leaving): Ok.
(Ross goes into the room where Dr. Green is laying unconscious. He turns on the TV, puts his feet on the bed and starts watching a dinosaur movie where the dinosaur is caught by two cowboys. Dr. Geller awakes.) 
Ross: Did the TV wake you?
Dr. Green: No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
Ross: Ouchy.
Dr. Green: What are you doing here, Geller?
Ross: Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! (pause) So what's new?
Dr. Green: Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
Ross: Right, is it painful?
Dr. Green: What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?
Ross (he buzzes for the nurse) Let's see if we can get that Rachel back here.
Dr. Green: So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
Ross: Nope, just the one. RACH!
¬†
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Phoebe is trying to teach Joey French.]
Phoebe: Je m'appelle Claude.
Joey: Je do call blue!
Phoebe: Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. ""je"".
Joey: je.
Phoebe: m'ap
Joey: mah
Phoebe: pelle
Joey: pel.
Phoebe: Great, ok faster! ""je""
Joey: je.
Phoebe: m'ap
Joey: mah
Phoebe: pelle
Joey: pel.
Phoebe: Je m'appelle!
Joey: Me pooh pooh!
Phoebe: Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
Joey: What are you doing?
Phoebe: I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall. (she leaves)
Joey: (he goes out calling her) Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! (he gives up). Pooh.

[Scene: Green's mansion. Rachel's Room. Rachel's is combing her hair; Ross's coming into the room] 
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. (pause) I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Rachel: Uh. (pause) Did you call your parents?
Ross: Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Rachel: Oh good.
Ross: Wow.
Rachel: What?
Ross: Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
Rachel: What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Ross: Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
Rachel: Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Ross: Sorry. (Rachel sits on her bed). You ok?
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: You had a rough day, uh?
Rachel: Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
Ross: But we do! (pause) It's gonna be ok, Rach!
Rachel: (she's sad) Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
Ross: What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
Rachel: What?
Ross: They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
Rachel: Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
Ross: No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Rachel: Ok, maybe you're right.
Ross: (he kisses her on her forehead) Good night.
Rachel: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
Ross: Sure!
Rachel: Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.
Ross: Oh, of course...
Rachel: Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Ross: Me too. Come here. (They hug)
Rachel: I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Ross: Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or...(There's one of those moments. They're staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
Rachel: Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Ross: No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Rachel: Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
Ross: Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
Rachel: Wow. Ok.
Ross: I'll see you in the morning (he leaves).
Rachel: Mhm-mh!
Ross: (outside her room, talking by himself) Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
¬†
[Scene: Monica's apartment. Monica and Erica have just arrived.]
Erica: Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
Monica: Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
Chandler: (enters the room wearing an ""I love New York"" t-shirt, a ""Statue of Liberty"" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!
Monica: What is with you?
Chandler: Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
Monica: Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
Erica: Thanks so much for showing me around.
Monica: Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Erica: Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)
Chandler: Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father? 
Erica: Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)
Chandler: That's great. 
Erica: Yeah... it's almost definitely him. (Monica and Chandler look confused now)
Monica: How's that now?
Erica: Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. 
Chandler: So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too? 
Erica: No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)
Monica: Was he falsely accused of something? (They look hopeful)
Erica: No... he killed his father with a shovel. (Monica and Chandler's jaws drop) But other than that, he's a great guy. 
Chandler: I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
(Time lapse. Chandler and Monica are in bed now)
Monica: Are you awake? 
Chandler: Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)
Monica: Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy. 
Chandler: Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
Monica: Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
Chandler: I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is. 
Monica: How? 
Chandler: I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
Monica: Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting. 
Chandler: Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!
¬†
[Scene: Joey's apartment. He is sitting on the barcalounger holding a French study book and listening to a French learning tape.]
Tape: We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.
Joey: Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
Tape: Good job.
Joey: Thank you. 
(Phoebe enters)
Phoebe: Hey Joey.
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
Joey: Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
Phoebe: Really, can I hear some of it. 
Joey: Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) ""Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu"" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though) See?
Phoebe: Well, you're not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH! 
Joey: (offended) Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
Phoebe: How could you possibly think that? 
Joey: For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
¬†
[Scene: The hospital. Rachel is pouring her self a cup of coffee. Ross approaches from behind.]
Ross: Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee? 
Rachel: (She turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)
Ross: You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay? 
Rachel: Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)
Ross: You sure you're alright?
Rachel: (coldly) Yep.
Ross: (knowing she's not alright) O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)
Rachel: FYI..
Ross: (knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)
Rachel: In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)
Ross: (half amused) Wait, wait, (looks around a little) You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Rachel: (sarcastically) Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
Ross: (acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...
Rachel: Oh stop that! 
Ross: I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding. 
Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
Ross: Hey, I was looking out for you.
Rachel: Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
Ross: I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
Rachel: Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)
Ross: Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
Rachel: What?
Ross: That's right, sex is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green, are you feeling better? (Rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look)
¬†
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica and Erica enter, Chandler is in the kitchen.]
Chandler: Hey! How was lunch?
Erica: (To Chandler) We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob (Monica smiles at Chandler and his he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife)
Chandler: (struggling) Oh, really? 
Erica: No! (To Monica) You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
Chandler: O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?
Monica: Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
Chandler: Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it? 
Monica: (smiling) No it's not. 
Chandler: How do you know? 
Erica: Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way. 
Chandler: Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Monica: The thing we never do.
Chandler: (nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!

[Scene: The theatre where Joey is auditioning. Phoebe enters when Joey's on stage and she sits down. He hasn't seen her.]
Director: Whenever you're ready Joey.
Joey: Right. (clears his throat) Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
Casting assistant: I'm sorry, what's going on?
Joey: Dude, come on! French it u-up!
Director: Joey, do you speak French?
Joey: Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Director: You know what. I think this audition is over. (Joey looks disappointed, but understands.)
Phoebe: (in a French accent) Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Regin√© Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Est√©e Lauder.
Director: You really think this man is speaking French?
Joey: Sa-sa-saw!
Phoebe: √âcoutez, je vais vous dire la v√©rit√©. C'est mon petit fr√®re. Il est un peu retard√©. (Translation: Listen, I will tell you the truth. He's my little bother. He's a bit retarded.)
(The director looks at Joey and he nods.)
Phoebe: Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... (Translation: So, would you please just humor him?) 
Director: (to Joey) Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
Joey: Ah. All right. But my French was good?
Director: It was great.
Joey: (to Phoebe) Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
Phoebe: (to the director) Merci. Au revoir. (Translation: Thanks, goodbye.)
Joey: Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting at the kitchen counter and Ross enters from Rachel and Emma's room.]
Ross: Emma's down for the night.
Rachel: Oh, good.
Ross: So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Rachel: Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say ""thank you"" for coming with me.
Ross: Oh, no problem.
Rachel: And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Ross: Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Rachel: It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
Ross: Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
Rachel: Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Ross: Oh, ye-ah!
Rachel: You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Ross: ...Valentine's day...
Both: (long pause, they realize) Oh yeah!
Rachel: Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
Ross: Hmmm-mmmm.
Rachel: (after a pause) Not even one more time?
Ross: Not even once.
Rachel: No matter how much we want it.
Ross: Even if we want it really bad.
Rachel: That's what we decided.
Ross: Uhm, right!
Rachel: ...It's kinda hard though!
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Ross: ...I hate waste.
Rachel: ...Ross?
Ross: Yes?
Rachel: Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)
Ross: Damn it. It's never off the table. (he leaves the apartment)

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe and Joey are ""updating"" Joey's resum√©.]
Phoebe: Okay, can you really tapdance?
Joey: No.
Phoebe: It's off the resum√©. (she strikes it through with a pencil)
Phoebe: Archery?
Joey: No.
Phoebe: Horseback riding?
Joey: Would fall off a lot.
Phoebe: You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Joey: That I can do.
Phoebe: Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Joey: All right, watch me! (he takes a full container of milk from the fridge) Okay, you time me. Ready?
Phoebe: Ready... GO!
(Joey takes the plastic container to his mouth and starts to drink. Most of the milk gushes from the bottle down his chin and over his clothes to the floor. He keeps ""drinking"" and all of a sudden he lifts it up and half the bottle of milk pours out in an instant. He then continues to drink the rest. He then puts the empty container down on the counter.)
Phoebe: (checking her watch) You did it!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are having a diner party with Phoebe and Mike.] 
Mike: (raising his glass) Thank you guys for having us over.
Phoebe: Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
Chandler: Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
Monica: Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
Chandler: You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)
Ross: (entering) Hey, you guys... I have great news.
Monica: Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
Ross: Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! (they all look at each other when Ross grabs a plate) Guess what happened at work today...
Chandler: A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Ross: Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
Phoebe: Wow!
Ross: Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
Rachel: (while entering) Hi you guys.
All: Hey.
Rachel: Ooh, Italian! (she also grabs a plate) 
Monica: No one wanted seconds, right?
Ross: No, no. I-I'm good.
Rachel: Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
Ross: I'm up for tenure.
Rachel: Congratulations!
Ross: You too! What are the odds?
Rachel: Ooh! (they hug)
Joey: (enters) Guess what? (they all look expectantly at him) I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
Monica: I don't know who I'm happiest for...
Phoebe: I do, he's been working on that all day! (looking at Joey)

OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler on their couch.] 
Phoebe: Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
Monica: No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this. (pats Chandler on his leg)
Phoebe: Where did you go to do it?
Monica: Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Chandler: YOU NEVER DID IT!
Monica: I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
Chandler: Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
Mike: (walks to the couch with coffee for Phoebe) Here you go.
Phoebe: Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
Mike: Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it. 
Phoebe: All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
Chandler: Mrs Hannigan?
Phoebe: What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
Joey: (enters) Hey guys.
Chandler: Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
Joey: No, thank you.
Monica: All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Chandler: Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
Joey: But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
Monica: Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
Joey: You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
Chandler: Damn it.
Monica: See you guys later.
Phoebe: Okay!
Monica: (to Joey) I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Phoebe: Good for you. That was really mature.
Joey: What? No, the only reason  I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
Mike: You're a strange kind of grown-up.
Phoebe: Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just... 
Mike: Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
Phoebe: All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
Joey: Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that ""thing"". What is it?
(Phoebe whispers something in Joey's ear, but after hearing it he jumps up, shocked)
Joey: I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! (he leaves)

[Scene: A restaurant. Rachel enters.]
Rachel: (to maitre d') Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
Maitre d': Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
(They walk to the table, but Rachel suddenly gasps. Sitting there is mr Zellner, her boss from her current job at Ralph Lauren.) 
Rachel: Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
Maitre d': I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
Rachel: But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
Maitre d': I know. With Gukki 
Rachel: Sssshhhh!
Mr Zellner: Rachel?
Rachel: Hi... I'm on a date...
Mr Zellner: (confused) That's great!
Rachel: Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
Mr Zellner: Well, you got uhm... good energy.
Rachel: Oh.
Mr Campbell: Rachel?
Rachel: Yes, hi!
Mr Campbell: James Campbell...
Rachel: Hi! (to mr Zellner) Excuse us.
Mr Campbell: Please... (shows her to sit)
Rachel: Okay. Oh, yeah... (whispering to mr Zellner) Oh he's cute!
Mr Campbell: So... your resum√© is quite impressive. (Mr Zellner who sits behind Rachel shrugs) 
Rachel: Wha... My resum√©? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resum√©.
Mr Campbell: Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resum√©.
Rachel: (starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened to just singing for  no reason? Huh?
Mr Campbell: Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
Rachel: What? I-I don't.
Mr Campbell: You don't?
Rachel: No, I-I-I love it there. 
Mr Campbell: Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
(Rachel mimes and mouths to mr Campbell ""That is my boss"", pointing to mr Zellner)
Mr Campbell: What?
(Rachel now silently whispers ""That's my boss"".)
Mr Campbell: That's Hugo Boss?
(Rachel holds her hand in order to support her head. Mr Zellner obviously overheard the conversation.)

[Scene: A  counter at a government building. Phoebe's waiting in line.]
Phoebe: (to the woman behind her) This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. (she turns around and the clerk behind the counter heard her.) But you obviously haven't.
Clerk: How can I help you? 
Phoebe: I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. (the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever) You're fun.
Clerk: You need to fill out this form. (motions for the next person in line) 
Phoebe: Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
Clerk: It can be anything you want.
Phoebe: Well, not anything, I mean...
Clerk: Yeah... anything.
Phoebe: Oh, this could take a while.
Clerk: Get out of my line.
Phoebe: Okay.
¬†
[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Monica are there when Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Hey Pheebs.
Phoebe: Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
Monica: Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
Phoebe: Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
Chandler: That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Monica: Phoebe!
Phoebe: Uh! Princess Consuela.
Monica: You seriously changed your name to that?
Phoebe: Uh-huh! 
Monica: Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Phoebe: Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
(Rachel enters, looking depressed)
Chandler: Hey, how'd the interview go?
Rachel: Oh! It's not good.
Chandler: You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
Rachel: Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
Chandler: That is a bad interview.
Phoebe: What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
Rachel: Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said ""Wait a minute! Yes I am."" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true. 
Monica: Oh God. I'm so sorry.
(Ross enters with a bottle in his hand)
Ross: Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? (showing the bottle) Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
Phoebe: Ross...
Ross: I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
All (except Rachel): Congratulations! (Rachel looks devastated)
Ross: This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Gunther: Six? You want me to join you?
Ross: Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. (Gunther leaves, hurt) Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow. 
Chandler: Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Ross: I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Rachel: Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
Ross: Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
Phoebe: Can you?
Rachel: Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
Ross: And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
Phoebe: And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. (Rachel mouths ""aah"")
Ross: But also knowing it means a lot.
Monica: But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Ross: ...that center around work.
Chandler: To Ross!
All (except Rachel): Ross!
(they all drink from the champagne, but clearly dislike the taste of it)
Ross: You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Phoebe: Oh God!
Ross: No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. (Rachel starts crying) Oh, look at you. Look  how happy you are for me.
Rachel: (crying) No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
Ross: Rach, I'm so sorry.
Rachel: Oh!
Ross: Great. I feel like an idiot.
Rachel: No, it's okay, you didn't know.
Ross: Oh... (to the others) Little heads-up would have been nice.

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's future house. They enter the living room with the realtor and Joey.]
Monica: Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Chandler: And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
Realtor: Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through. (she leaves the room) 
Monica: Ah, so glad you decided to come.
Joey: Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
Chandler: What?
Joey: Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Monica: No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Joey: Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Monica: Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
Joey: Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs out and hits him) 
Monica: No it's not!
Joey: (squinting his eyes) Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
Chandler: When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Joey: (glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
Monica: Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here. 
Joey: FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. (He turns his back to them and starts humming) Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... 
Monica: Joey, we know that's you.
Joey: no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm

[Scene: Phoebe is at Central Perk. Mike enters.]
Mike: Hey (He kisses Phoebe)
Phoebe: Welcome back!
Mike: Ah! I missed you
Phoebe: Oh, me too!
Mike: So, what's new?
Phoebe: Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
Mike: That's great! You changed you name?
Phoebe: Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock! (She smiles from ear to ear)
Mike: (afraid) You're kidding right?
Phoebe: Nope.
Mike: You really did that? 
Phoebe: Yep.
Mike: Yeah, but you can't do that.
Phoebe: Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
Mike: (looks at her astonished) Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.
Phoebe: Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
Mike: Crap Bag.
Phoebe:(not amused) Mike Crap Bag?
Mike: No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.
Phoebe: You're not serious, right?
Mike: Yeah, I'm serious. (sarcastic) It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!
Phoebe: Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it. 
Mike: I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.
Phoebe: And I love Crap.

[Scene: Joey is in Monica and Chandler's future house, sitting in a child's bedroom, looking at a quiz card which has ""5+10="" printed on one side.]
Joey: (turns the card around, obviously had the wrong answer) Ow!
(A young girl enters)
Girl: Who are you?
Joey: Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
Girl: I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
Joey: (understanding) Oh.
Mackenzie: (sighs) I hate my parents.
Joey: I hate my friends. (They shake on it as if they just made a pact) Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
Mackenzie: Like what? 
Joey: (thinking) Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
Mackenzie: What are you? Eight? 
Joey: Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
Mackenzie: I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
Joey: (frustrated) Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean? 
Mackenzie: I really don't.
Joey: What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
Mackenzie: My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
Joey: Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
Mackenzie: This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. (Joey glares at her angrily) Look, you want your friends to be happy, right? 
Joey: Yeah, yeah, I guess.
Mackenzie: Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it? 
Joey: (having difficulty admitting it) Yeah, maybe.
Mackenzie: Then you gotta let them go. 
Joey: (In near tears, realizes she is right) I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
Mackenzie: I read a lot.
Joey: (his mood changes instantly) Just when I thought we could be friends. (he leaves the room)

[Scene: Outside Ralph Lauren building. Rachel just walked out carrying a box of her stuff, and a strange man approaches her.]
Man: Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
Rachel: Oh, thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)
Man: You still don't know my name, do you? 
Rachel: (Is embarrassed for a moment, but it quickly passes) Well, now I don't have to. (The man leaves instantly)
(In the meantime, Ross is trying to squeeze and push a rather large chair through the revolving doors of the Ralph Lauren building.)
Rachel: (annoyed) Ross, what is taking you so long?
Ross: (stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder, looking very annoyed. He finally manages) (sarcastic) I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
(Mark, approaches from behind and recognizes her)
Mark: Rachel?
Rachel: (turns around) Mark? Oh my God! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
Mark: How've you been?
Rachel: I'm fantastic. You remember Ross? 
Mark: Sure, sure. (To Ross) What's with the chair. (Rachel signals him not to mention she's been fired)
Ross: Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so... (laughs stupidly) 
Mark: Clever. (back to Rachel) So how are you?
Rachel: Oh, well, (looks at her box and chair) you're not catching me on my best day.
Mark: Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
Rachel: No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
Mark: Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
Rachel: Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
Mark: Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
Rachel: Great! I'll call ya!
Mark: (shakes Ross' hand) Nice to see you.
Ross: Yeah! yeah, I got tenure! (Mark looks at him strangely and walks off)
Rachel: (very excited) Oh my God!
Ross: See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Rachel: Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
Ross: (realizing) That is Mark?
Rachel: Yes.
Ross: I hate that guy.
Rachel: Oh.
Ross: No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
Rachel: What? You don't want me to get a job?
Ross: Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
Rachel: Ugh. 
Ross: I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Rachel: Ross, you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into, and out of the camera's view, and then nonchalantly walks away)

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's new house. Sitting near the window, they look at the neighborhood.]
Monica: Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Chandler: Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: Hey, where have you been?
Joey: Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
Chandler: Really? What changed your mind?
Joey: Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
Chandler: Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
(Joey's eyes double in size)
Joey: (frightened) What?
Chandler: Ha! I'm just messing with you.
Joey: That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Monica: Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
Joey: What? I get my own room?
Chandler: You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Joey: Oh my God! (they all hug) Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
Chandler and Monica: No!
Joey: Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are leaving.]
Mike: After you, miss Banana Hammock.
Phoebe: Thank you, mister Bag.
(a woman enters and recognizes Phoebe)
Woman: Oh hey, how are you?
Phoebe: Oh hi Rita! Good! (to Mike) Oh, Rita's a massage client.
Mike: Oh! Why don't you introduce me?
Phoebe: (shrugs) Er, Rita, this is my husband.
Rita: Oh! (they shake hands)
Phoebe: Yeah.
Mike: Why don't you tell her my name?
Phoebe: (without moving her lips, wearing a fake smile) Okay, I will. (to Rita) This is my husband Crap Bag.
Rita: Crap Bag?
Mike: If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.
Rita: Okay. Excuse me...
Phoebe: Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
Mike: Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe: How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
Mike: Really?
Phoebe: Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Mike: Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
Phoebe: It's a funny word.
Mike: It's a Speedo.
Phoebe: ...Oh crap!

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Ross enters.]
Ross: Hey, is Rachel here?
Monica: No.
Ross: She's still at dinner?
Monica: I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Ross: That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
Chandler: It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) My time machine works!
Ross: We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Monica: So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
Chandler: Excuse me?
Monica: Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
Chandler: For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
Monica: Oh, sorry!
(She looks at Ross, a bit ashamed. Chandler mimes ""big breasts"" to Ross and lip syncs ""Wow"". Ross looks at him, astonished and then Monica looks at Chandler again. A little too late he changes the ""big breasts"" mime into ""rocking a baby"". When he realizes Monica might have seen it he also strokes his imaginary baby's head.)
Rachel: (entering) Hi you guys!
Ross: Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Rachel: Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Ross: (speaking without pause, agitated) Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Rachel: Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
Ross: Should we send something?
Chandler: How did the job stuff go?
Rachel: He offered me one.
Chandler: That's great!
Ross: Congratulations!
Rachel: I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
Ross: Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Rachel: The job is in Paris. (they all stare at each other)

COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's. Joey's on the phone.]
Joey: I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
Mackenzie: (at the other end of the line) I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on. (she puts the phone at the bears ear)
Joey: Hey bear, I need some career advice.

Chandler: My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica 
  looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
Ross: All right, we'll work it out.
Rachel: Thank you! Thank you!
Ross: Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?
Rachel: I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe 
  and Joey enter.)
Phoebe: Ooh, what's going on?
Rachel: I got a really incredible job offer.
Joey: Hey, great! All right!
Phoebe: Good for you!
Rachel: It's in Paris.
Joey: What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, 
  okay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to 
  Monica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid 
  suburbs...
Monica: Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
Joey: Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Rachel: Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means 
  a lot if you could try to get on board.
Phoebe: Of course we can. Congratulations. (they hug, but Joey shakes his head.) 
  Yay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in) Joey...
Joey: No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
Rachel: (walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so...
Joey: Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and 
  Rachel follows him)
Rachel: Joey...
Phoebe: You okay with this?
Chandler: Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
Phoebe: Talking to Ross.
Chandler: I see.
Ross: Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every 
  day. How can I be okay with this?
Monica: I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Ross: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, 
  she would take it?
Monica: How is that gonna happen?
Chandler: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Ross: I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas 
  party. We really hit it off.
Monica: You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
Ross: I didn't say we were brothers.

  OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe's reading a newspaper. Chandler 
  and Monica walk in.]
Monica: Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next 
  door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna 
  take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
Chandler: We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse 
  us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Monica: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Chandler: What do you think Pheebs?
Phoebe: Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin 
  Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
Chandler: Yeah.
Phoebe: She died.
Chandler: You're kidding!
Monica: That's terrible!
Phoebe: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across 
  the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the 
  wrong one.
Chandler: Oh yeah? 
Phoebe: Yeah, she was just an agent.
Monica: Joey's gonna be *so* upset. 
Chandler: I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the 
  Atlantic.
Phoebe: Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about 
  everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
Monica: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
Phoebe: Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get 
  used to everything else.
Monica: What if he reads it in the paper?
Chandler: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.

[Scene: Ralph Lauren. Mr Zelner's office. Ross knocks on the 
  door and enters.]
Mr Zelner: May I help you?
Ross: Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas 
  party about two years ago.
Mr Zelner: Oh right, uhm, Don?
Ross: Close. Ron. (shakes hands)
Mr Zelner: Uh... What can I do for you?
Ross: Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Mr Zelner: Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
Ross: Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll 
  see if she wants to come back.
Mr Zelner: Wow, that is tempting. 
Ross: Look, she loved her job here. And let's face 
  it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that 
  true?
Mr Zelner: She is good!
Ross: (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.
Mr Zelner: But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, 
  it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
Ross: I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his 
  way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one 
  up.) Is this your son?

Mr Zelner: Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What?
Ross: Oh, nothing, it‚Äôs just, it‚Äôs close to Ron. Does he.. Does 
  little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance? 
Mr Zelner: Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
Ross: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after 
  everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. 
  (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that‚Äôs 
  not good. Let me start again. I‚Äôm a paleontologist, you‚Äôll be there 
  with us and the touching refers only to bones‚Ä¶ fossils!
Mr Zelner: You can really arrange that?
Ross: You let Rachel come back, and it‚Äôs done. 
Mr Zelner: Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn‚Äôt be the worst thing 
  in the world.
Ross: Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, 
  your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Mr Zelner: That‚Äôs great. I worry about little Ross. He‚Äôs always 
  reading, he's collecting rocks and he‚Äôs obsessed with dinosaurs.
Ross: He‚Äôll be fine.

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe‚Äôs reading, Joey has just entered 
  the room]
Joey: Hey Phoebe.
Phoebe: Hey. Everything ok?
Joey: I‚Äôm just mad at my agent.
Phoebe: Estelle? Why?
Joey: There‚Äôs a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I 
  didn‚Äôt even be put up for it! She‚Äôd better have a good reason.
Phoebe: I‚Äôm guessing she does.
 Joey: Well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I‚Äôm wanna hear it, 
  because she keeps doing this.
Phoebe: Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you 
  will wait a minute before you call her.
Joey: Ok. Why?
Phoebe: Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. 
  (she leaves)
Joey: I love that saying!
(Phoebe is outside, taking her cell phone out of her bag and making a call. 
  Joey is inside, and his mobile phone starts ringing).
Joey: Hello?
Phoebe (doing Estelle): Joey, it‚Äôs Estelle.
Joey: I was just gonna call you! That‚Äôs weird.
Phoebe-Estelle: It‚Äôs a little coincidental, but believable. 
  (Joey nods in agreement). Listen, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre wondering why 
  I didn‚Äôt get you an audition for that TV movie.
Joey: Yeah, actually I am!
Phoebe-Estelle: I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie! 

Joey: That‚Äôs it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
Phoebe-Estelle: Don‚Äôt take that tone with me. Who you 
  think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
Joey: No, no, look. All I‚Äôm saying is that you‚Äôre my agent, ok? 
  And you‚Äôre not getting me into any auditions and I‚Äôm tired of it.
Phoebe-Estelle: What are you saying?
Joey: I‚Äôm saying that‚Ä¶ (pause). This isn't  working for me 
  anymore, ok? Estelle, you‚Äôre fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).
Phoebe: Man, tough week for Estelle!
¬†
[Scene: Joey‚Äôs apartment. Rachel‚Äôs there and Ross 
  enters the room with a stuffed dinosaur]
Ross: Hi.
Rachel: Hi.
Ross: Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can‚Äôt sleep 
  without it.
Rachel: Oh, well, she‚Äôs asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Ross: Ok.
Rachel: Oh, you‚Äôre not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph 
  Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Ross: Nooo!
Rachel: Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out 
  of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling 
  apart without me.
Ross: So, you‚Äôre not going to Paris.
Rachel: No, I‚Äôm still going.
Ross: Wh‚Ä¶ wh‚Ä¶what?
Rachel: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, 
  the offered me more money! Isn‚Äôt that great?
Ross: Yeeeah! (They high-five) 
¬†
[Scene: house next to the one the Bings are moving into. Chandler 
  and Monica knock, a lady opens the door.]
Monica: Hi. We‚Äôre buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we 
could just take a look around.
Lady: Oh, sure. I‚Äôm showing it to someone else right now, 
  but please, look around.
Monica: Thanks.
Chandler: It feels like we‚Äôre cheating on our house. 
  And if we‚Äôre gonna cheat, shouldn‚Äôt it be with like a hot, younger house, 
  that does stuff that our house won‚Äôt do?
Monica: Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks 
  like a cave! What a hole!
Lady: So? What do you think?
Monica: Love it!
Lady: Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady 
  upstairs is goning to make another one.
Monica: They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
Lady: Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, 
  he's on Wall Street and she‚Ä¶
Janice: Oh my God!
(Chandler and Monica are speechless).
Chandler (to Monica): Sure.

[Scene: Joey‚Äôs apartment. He‚Äôs there and Phoebe comes 
  in.]
Phoebe: Hey Joey, want come with me to‚Ä¶ are you ok?
Joey: Yeah, I just‚Ä¶ I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be 
  killing her.
Phoebe: No, that wouldn‚Äôt kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
Joey: I don‚Äôt know. She‚Äôs got to be taking it hard, I was like 
  her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I‚Äôm guessing 
  he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she‚Äôs not a great agent, but 
  she did stick with me for ten years. I‚Äôm gonna call her and hire her again.
Phoebe: No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call 
  you (Joey considers it)
Joey: Why?
Phoebe: Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ... 
  is the key... to a happy heart.
Joey: (impressed) You blow me away. 
Phoebe: (picking up her bag) All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her 
  to call you?
Joey: I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. (Phoebe stops 
  herself from laughing and leaves)
¬†
[Scene: The house Monica and Chandler are viewing. Janice comes 
  down the stairs.]
Janice: What a small world!
Chandler: And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Realtor: You two know each other?
Janice: Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man 
  out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! (does her irritating 
  laugh). So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna 
  have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie (playfully punches Chandler, 
  who tries to get away from her)
Chandler: (at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)
Monica: No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)
Chandler: (To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?
Monica: (looks confused and scared) I don't know 
  why.
Janice: Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. 
  But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to 
  get it! (Chandler and Monica are utterly shocked) Ellen, we're going to talk 
  numbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside) 
Chandler: This can not be happening!
Monica: Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. 
  Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Chandler: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple 
  are the Hitlers.
Monica: (Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands) 
  All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house 
  into a guest house.
Chandler: That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, 
  but when did you start crapping money!?
Monica: Okay, you come up with an idea.
Chandler: Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on 
  our house. We can still get out.
Monica: But we love our house.
Chandler: Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder 
  out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) ""Oh My God""! 

Monica: Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever 
  we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. 
  I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls 
  jump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking 
  it pushing something up)
Chandler: (looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we 
  have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly 
  outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)
¬†
[Scene: Mr. Zellner's office. There is a knock on the door.]
r Zelner: Who is it?
Ross: (enters) It's me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed) 
  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might 
  be able to get her to come back. 
Mr Zelner: This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, 
  is not my main job.
Ross: Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks 
  hopeful)
Mr Zelner: (obviously amused) Not good, Ron. 
Ross: Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this (Takes 
  a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.
Mr Zelner: (Takes a long look at the egg while he considers it) Wow, that's 
  pretty cool (Takes the egg from Ross)
Ross: Huh? So? We have a deal?
Mr Zelner: Okay, you got it.
Ross: Yes! yes! 
Mr Zelner: This is gonna make me very popular.
Ross: Oh, (grins) Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
Mr Zelner: (looks at Ross, for a long moment, confused) I meant with my son.
Ross: Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. (shakes his head, give him a thumbs 
  up and leaves)
¬†
[Scene: Joey's apartment. He walks in reading his mail, and plays 
  back his messages on the answering machine]
Answering machine: Joey, this is Al T. Booker, (Looks annoyed 
that he called him) the guy who eats paper. I'm sure you've heard that Estelle 
passed away. (Looks shocked) I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her 
at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it. 
Joey: Oh my God. (Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) Hello?
Phoebe: (on the other side of the line, still pretending to be Estelle) Joey, 
  it's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)
Joey: Estelle?
Phoebe: Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for 
  firing me.
Joey: (still scared) Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
Phoebe: Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
Joey: No, no, no! (Starts looking around the room, terrified) Don't drop by, 
  don't drop by!
Phoebe: Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
Joey: Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
Phoebe: (Looks around) It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with 
  the career. You're gonna be huge.
Joey: Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs up and reads the phone display) 
  ""out of area"". Boy, I'll say.
¬†
[Scene: The house next door to Chandler and Monica's new house. 
  Chandler is pacing worriedly through the living room when Janice enters.]
Janice: Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on 
the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.
Chandler: The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Janice: All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see 
  you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)
Chandler: Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to 
  be here.
Janice: Oh, me too... (laughs)
Chandler: Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Janice: Huh?
Chandler: I never stopped loving you.
Janice: Oh... my...
Chandler: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice 
  Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Janice: Chandler, what are you talking about?
Chandler: Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and 
  Monica never have to know a thing.
Janice: I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... 
  heat between us.
Chandler: (stunned) Obviously.
Janice: But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't 
  think we should get this house now.
Chandler: Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Janice: Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
Chandler: I understand.
Janice: Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... (she kisses 
  Chandler flat on the mouth. Chandler squirms. When she's finished, he looks 
  at her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing. (She leaves)
Chandler: (speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.
¬†
[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is working on his laptop when 
  Rachel enters with Emma.]
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Ross: What?
Rachel: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered 
  me more money.
Ross: They did?
Rachel: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll 
  do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I 
  don't even know what department that guy's in.
Ross: So, what are you gonna do?
Rachel: Well, I took it.
Ross: That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Both: YAY! WHOO! YAY!
Ross: You're excited, right?
Rachel: (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. 
  It's certainly the easier choice...
Ross: Right!
Rachel: Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to 
  Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital 
  of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's 
  fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of 
  that I possibly can... (she sits down, and Ross who is stunned to hear all this 
  follows her example)
Ross: Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. 
  Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Rachel: Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when 
  I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... 
  But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)
Ross: (after a long pause) You should go.
Rachel: What?
Ross: It's what you want. You should go.
Rachel: You really think so?
Ross: I really do.
Rachel: But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
Ross: (picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in 
  the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) I'm sure he'll 
  understand.
Rachel: All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Ross: Yeah...
Rachel: Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
Ross: Yeah, yeah, oh! (They hug)
Rachel: Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
Ross: Then I'm happy too. (They're still hugging - fade out)
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Estelle's memorial service. Joey is giving a speech. 
  Next to him is a blown op photograph of Estelle behind her desk and there's 
  a man standing next to him.]
Joey: Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects 
  to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (Joey looks at the photograph) 
  ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (Joey 
  looks for his notes. The man next to him is chewing something.) Dude, where's 
  my speech? (the man swallows something and looks at Joey.) That is 
  entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. (he applauds and Al shows that there's 
  nothing left in his mouth.)

[Scene: Joey's place. Rachel and Joey are talking]
Joey: All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
Rachel: Ok! Can't believe I'm risking  this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
Joey: Just flip!
Rachel (she flips the coin): Ha, tails!
Joey: Damnit!
(Chandler and Monica enter the room)
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Rachel: Oh, that sounds good!
Monica: Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
Rachel: It's all done!
Monica: Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
Rachel: I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
Monica: Ok,  so you've done some good work! (pause) What about your carry-ons?
Rachel: Oh, well. Everything that I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
Monica: Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! (they hug)
Chandler: Where's your passport?
Rachel: It should be right next to my plane ticket.
Chandler: Well, it's not.
Rachel: What? Maybe I put it in here (she opens her bag). Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
Monica: Here, let me help you. (they both start opening boxes)
Rachel: Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
Chandler (to Joey): At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?
¬†
OPENING SEQUENCE
[Scene: Monica's apartment. Monica and Erica are talking about the baby, and Monica is rubbing Erica's tummy.]
Monica: Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
Erica: I know.
Monica: You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
Erica: No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
(She takes her hand off Erica. Ross enters the room)
Ross: Hey! 
Erica: Hi.
Ross: Hey Erica, welcome back to town! (pause) Wow, look how big you've gotten.
Erica: That's because I'm pregnant!
Ross: Right, no, I understand.
Erica: Oh, ok.  I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts. 
Ross: No, no, I knew (he stares at her breasts).
Monica (to Ross): Okay, well, stop staring at them.
Ross: She brought them up! (pause) I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Erica: Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
Monica: Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Ross: Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Monica: Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Erica: Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
Ross: Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Monica: Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
Erica (standing up): I'll be right back.
Ross: Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
Monica: Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
Ross: No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost  to feed Joey?
Monica: Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Ross: Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Monica: Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Ross: Mhm, (he balance things) packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Monica: Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
(Ross takes the tape roll she's handing him and walks to the guest room while mocking Monica's voice)
¬†
[Scene: Guest room. Joey has his head wrapped in bubbled wrap and Chandler is punching him. Ross enters the room.]
Ross: What are you guys doing?
Joey: Try it, I can't feel a thing! (Ross starts punching him too)
Monica (enters the room): Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
Chandler: We're taking a break!
Monica: From?
Chandler: Jumping on the bed?
Monica: All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
Ross: You got it! (Monica leaves, Ross closes the door). All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
Chandler: No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
(Joey takes the bubble wrap off his head)
Joey: You guys hear a ringing?
Chandler: (holding a pair of furry handcuffs) What the hell is this?
Joey: Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
Ross: Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
Chandler: I didn't know Monica had these!
Joey: Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
Chandler: Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Ross: Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
¬†
[Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe and Ross enter the room.]
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Hey! Where's Mike?
Phoebe: Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
Ross: Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
Phoebe: Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
Ross: Rock on!
Phoebe (watching the food on the table): Wow, this is quite a spread! (pause) What is all this stuff?
Monica: Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Joey: (entering the room) Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Ross: Hey, where's Rach?
Joey: Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
Ross: Great.
Joey: Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
Monica: Yeah.
(Rachel enters the room)
Everybody: Hey Rach, hey you.
Ross: Here she is!
Rachel (crying): Hi you guys!
Joey: What did I just say?
Rachel: No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Monica: Come here, I'll make you a drink.
Ross: Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
Chandler: I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks puzzled) I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
Joey (to Ross): You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
Ross: Yeah?
Joey: Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. (he stops and starts realizing something) Wait a minute...
Chandler: Yes, Joe?
Joey: I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
Phoebe (to Rachel): You doing ok?
Rachel: Well, I've been better.
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Rachel: You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
Phoebe: Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
Rachel: I'm gonna miss you so much.
Phoebe: I know.
Rachel: You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here (they go into the guest room).
Ross: Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Joey: Huh, if I had to  guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
¬†
[Scene: Guest room. Rachel and Phoebe are sitting on the bed.]
Rachel: Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
Phoebe: Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  (she takes something out from her pocket) but I do have something for you.
Rachel: Oh, oh. (she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?
Phoebe: It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
Rachel: I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture! 
¬†
[Scene: Monica's apartment. The living room.]
Monica: Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.
Chandler: Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna  engage on a little light bondage and moustache play! 
Monica: What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
Chandler: Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!
Monica: That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Chandler: Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Monica: Rachel used to live in that room.
Chandler: Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)
Monica: Joey's bare ass!
Chandler: (he doesn't look excited anymore). Well played.
(Phoebe and Rachel enter the living room.)
Rachel: I love you Phoebe.
Phoebe: I love you too. (they hug) Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch! (they hug again)
Rachel: All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
Phoebe: Ok.
Rachel: Ok. Monica?
Monica: Yeah?
Rachel: Can you come here with me for a minute?
Monica: Sure.
Phoebe: (to Monica) Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
Monica: No.
Phoebe: Oh, you're so screwed. (Monica goes into the guest room)
Ross: (to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?
Phoebe: She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Ross: Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Phoebe: Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
Ross: Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
¬†
[Scene: The guest bedroom. Rachel and Monica are talking to each other.]
Rachel: Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
Monica: I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too. 
Rachel: (starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she's saying) I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you... 
Monica: (having the same problem) You're the best friend I ever had.
Rachel: (says something that cannot be understood)
Monica: What? 
Rachel: I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)
Monica: That is so sweet. (they hug)
¬†
[Scene: Back to the living room. Monica and Rachel enter and hug each other. The guys see this.]
Ross: (to Joey) Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
Chandler: Uh, Rach?
Ross: Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her. 
Joey: I really made you think about that thing uh?
Chandler: (to Rachel) Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
Rachel: (laughs) Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
Chandler: No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
Rachel: Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
Chandler: Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Rachel: Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Chandler: Pheebs!
Phoebe: (from the other side of the room) Yeah!
Chandler: I think these are yours.
Phoebe: These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Rachel: (to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Chandler: Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Phoebe: Where do you think Mike really is? (she giggles, Chandler looks aghast) 
¬†
[Scene: The guest bedroom. Chandler and Rachel.]
Rachel: Oh honey... 
Chandler: Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Rachel: (all mushy) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug) 
Chandler: Ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
Rachel: Okay. Oh...
(Chandler blows raspberry again)
Rachel: Oh!
Chandler: I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't. 
¬†
[Scene: Monica's living room. We look outside to the balcony where Rachel is saying goodbye to Joey.]
Monica: (to Ross) So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
Ross: I don't think so. 
Chandler: Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
Monica: You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Chandler: That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. 
Ross: God! I can't believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) Why are they taking so long? 
Phoebe: I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
(Rachel and Joey hug, and Rachel turns to enter the apartment through the side window again. At that moment Joey tries to climb over the edge of the balcony.)
All: No, no, no, no!
(Rachel rushes back and pulls Joey back onto the balcony, and takes him inside.)  
Ross: Okay, here we go...
Rachel: Oh... (holding Ross's shoulder) Well...
Ross: Yeah...
Rachel: I think I'm gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back, but he looks very surprised) 
Ross: Huh?
Rachel: Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
(She leaves the apartment and they all stare at Ross)
Ross: What? I don't get a goodbye? 
Joey: (still very emotional) Lucky bastard!
¬†
[Scene: Monica's apartment continued... Phoebe, Chandler, Monica and Joey are sitting down and Ross is pacing up and down.]
Ross: Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Monica: Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Ross: Well, it needs to be plicit.
Joey: All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad? 
Ross: No, I don't think so.
Phoebe: You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
Monica: Yeah. Mine too.
Chandler: Mine was a humdinger  
Ross: (annoyed) O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? (Joey gives Ross a hug) NOT FROM YOU! (Joey lets go)
Phoebe: Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
Monica: And say what? ""You owe me a goodbye"", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
Ross: THE HELL I DO!
(Ross takes big steps leaving for Joey and Rachel's apartment, where Rachel is going through her papers.)
Ross: I don't get a goodbye?
Rachel: What?
Ross: (talking agitated and angry) Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
Rachel: Ross...
Ross: Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)
¬†
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. The others are still there.]
Monica: I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Joey: I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Phoebe: Tell me about it.
Chandler: Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
Phoebe: All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
Monica: Uh, where do you think you're going?
Phoebe: I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
Monica: We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Chandler: Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Joey: Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he mimes hitting his head with his fist)
Monica: Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Chandler: (to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
Monica: Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
Phoebe and Joey: Yeah.
Monica: Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
Chandler: Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Monica: You did? How?
Chandler: Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Monica: Oh my God! Let me see. (they all look at the pictures)
Joey: Who's that dirty old lady?
Chandler: Monica's grandmother.
Monica: Nana liked it rough!
(Erica, the pregnant girl, enters)
Erica: Hi!
All: Hey!
Joey: Come on here, have a seat.
Phoebe: How was your night?
Erica: Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... (she looks likes she is in pain, holding her belly) Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
Monica: Erica, are you okay?
Erica: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Monica: Oh my God!
Chandler: Relax! We just get her some antacids.
Monica: She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
Chandler: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
Monica: All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh! (she's hyperventilating)
Chandler: Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Erica: You can do this. Just breathe.
Monica: Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
Erica: (in pain) Ooh! Are you sure?
Monica: Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
(there's a lot of supportive cheers from all. Erica, Monica and Chandler leave.)
Joey: Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
Chandler: What?
Joey: If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
¬†
[Scene: Ross's apartment. Rachel bursts in.]
Rachel: You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Ross: That's what it seemed like.
Rachel: I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Ross: Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Rachel: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
Ross: Rach!
Rachel: What?
Ross: You keep, you keep... You can't...
Rachel: WHAT?
(Ross walks over to her and starts to kiss her passionately. After a while Rachel backs out. She thinks a while and starts kissing him back.)
¬†
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment.]
Joey: A little more.
Phoebe: Okay. (she starts to stuff styrofoam peanuts down the front of Joey's pants.)
Joey: A little more, a little more. (she stuffs some more down his pants and Joey's assesses the how many there already are in there.) A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
Phoebe: All right, ready?
Joey: Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
Phoebe: All right, here it goes...
(she knees him in the crotch. He jumps up a bit)
Joey: (in pain) Doesn't work... (he falls down on on his knees with his head on the floor)

Rachel's Going Away Party.]
Jennifer Aniston (V.O.): Previously on Friends.

Erica: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these 
  stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Monica: Oh my God!
Chandler: Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Monica: She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!

[Cut to Ross's apartment. Ross and Rachel are there. It's another 
  scene from 1016 TOW Rachel's Going Away Party.]
Rachel: So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't 
  mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you 
  mean more to me.
Ross: Rach!
Rachel: What?!
(He walks over and kisses her. They pull back, Rachel looks at him, 
and they kiss again.)

[Scene: Ross's bedroom. Rachel is putting on her shoes as Ross shows 
  up from underneath the covers.]
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Ross: Oh. This was amazing.
Rachel: It really was. You've learned some new moves!
Ross: Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me ""Sex for Dummies"" as a 
  joke.
Rachel: Ah.
Ross: Who's laughing now?
Rachel: I know!
(They kiss.)

OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: The delivery room at the hospital. Monica, Chandler and Erica 
  are there. Erica is in labor, and she is breathing heavily.]
Monica: Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
Chandler: Next time, can I say breathe?
Monica: No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can 
  I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
Erica: No, I'm okay.
Monica: Alright, I'll be right back.
Chandler: Where are you going?
Monica: To use the bathroom.
Chandler: You can't leave me alone with her.
Monica: What?
Chandler: This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not 
  comfortable with!
Monica: What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
Chandler: It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone 
  together.
Monica: You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two 
  minutes.
Chandler: Okay.
(Monica leaves, and Chandler closes the door. Erica just looks at 
  him.)
Chandler: So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Erica: I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
Chandler: Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which 
  is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
Erica: What?
Chandler: Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will 
  ever know, because no one can experience both.
(Erica just looks at him like he's crazy.)
Chandler: One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who 
  knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? 
Like this.
¬†
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Joey is there as Phoebe enters. 
  Joey is holding a baby duck.]
Phoebe: Morning.
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: What's that?
Joey: It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Phoebe: It's a baby chick and duck!
Joey: Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Phoebe: I did not see that coming.
Joey: Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It 
  has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to 
  that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
Phoebe: Yes.
Joey: Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Phoebe: That is the rule, though.
(Ross enters.)
Phoebe: Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Ross: What?
Joey: Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are 
  at the hospital right now!
Ross: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Ross: Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Phoebe: Have you seen him throw a ball?
Ross: Is Rachel here?
Joey: Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you 
  guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
Ross: Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
Phoebe: What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Ross: Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have 
  sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Joey: Oh my God. You and Rachel?
Ross: I know, it's pretty great.
Joey: So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
Ross: Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
Phoebe: But do you wanna get back together?
Ross: I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. 
  When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know 
  what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
Phoebe: (screaming) YAY!
Ross: Shhh!
Phoebe: (quietly) Yay!
Joey: So, so is she still going to Paris?
Ross: Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
Phoebe: Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get 
  back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are 
  chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! 
  (Singing) ""Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And 
  the moon comes...""
(Rachel enters from her room.)
Rachel: Morning!
Phoebe: Guess we'll never know how it ends.
Joey: Okay.
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Hey.
Ross: Hey. How did you sleep?
Rachel: Good. You?
Ross: Good.
Joey: I bet you did!
Ross: Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Joey: Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Rachel: Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
Phoebe: (interrupting) Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on 
  the farm.
(Joey and Phoebe leave.)
Ross: So...
(He kisses her.)
Ross: Morning.
Rachel: You too. Last night was just wonderful.
Ross: It really was.
Rachel: I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Ross: I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those 
  things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's 
  everything you want it to be.
Rachel: Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (She hugs him, and Ross looks crushed.)
¬†
[Scene: The Hospital. Erica is moaning and about to give birth. 
  Monica, Chandler, a nurse and a doctor are there with her.]
Monica: It's just a little bit more, honey.
Erica: Help me! This hurts!
Chandler: Is it really that bad?
Erica: Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which 
  is worse!
(Monica gives Chandler a look.)
Doctor: The baby's head is crowning.
(Monica walks down to Erica's legs to watch the birth.)
Monica: Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have 
  ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
(Chandler is standing by Erica's head.)
Chandler: I'm okay.
Monica: Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your 
  child! It's the miracle of life!
Chandler: Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Doctor: Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...
(The baby starts crying, and the doctor holds it up.)
Monica: It's a... It's a boy!
Chandler: Wow!
Erica: Is he okay?
Doctor: He's just fine.
Monica: Oh, you did it!
Chandler: (emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some
  other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Doctor: Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
(A nurse gives Monica a pair of scissors. Monica gives it to Chandler, 
  and they cut it together.)
Chandler: Well, that's spongy.
Monica: (to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much
  that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on
  the verge of tears) Oh, we are so lucky!
Chandler: I know. He has your eyes.
(Monica looks at him.)
Chandler: I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
Nurse: We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
(The doctor hands the boy to the nurse, and she walks over to another 
  part of the room with him.)
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: (To Erica) Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
Erica: I'm really happy for you guys.
Chandler: How do you feel?
Erica: I'm tired!
Doctor: Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one 
  will be along in a minute.
(Chandler stares at the doctor, completely shocked. Monica just 
  freezes and turns around slowly.)
Monica: I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
Doctor: The next baby should be along in a minute.
Monica: We only ordered one!
Doctor: You know it's twins, right?
Chandler: Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: The hospital. Continued from earlier.]
Doctor: I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never 
  happened before.
Chandler: Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Monica: (to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?
Doctor: Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in 
  Ohio.
Monica: (to Erica) Anybody tell you?
Erica: I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about 
  two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They 
  kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, 
  that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.
Monica: This is unbelievable.
Erica: Twins actually run in my family.
Chandler: Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?
(They walk over to the door.)
Chandler: What do we do?
Monica: What do you mean ""what do we do""?
Chandler: (panicking) Twins! Twins!!
Monica: Chandler, you're panicking!
Chandler: Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep
  one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
Monica: We can't split them up!
Chandler: Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and 
  then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, 
  that's a great day for everybody.
Monica: Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Chandler: What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Monica: Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Chandler: Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Monica: That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't 
  care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't 
  care if the entire cast of ""Eight is Enough"" comes out of there! We 
  are taking them home, because they are our children!
Chandler: (smiles) Okay. Shhh...
(He hugs her.)
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Okay!
Chandler: Okay!
Doctor: It looks like we're about ready over here.
(Monica and Chandler run back to Erica's bed.)
Doctor: Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
Erica: Ow!
(Erica screams.)
Doctor: Here she comes!
Chandler: (shocked) She? It's a girl?
Doctor: Yeah.
Chandler: (To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor) 
  And that's enough!
¬†
[Scene: Central Perk. Ross, Phoebe and Joey are there.]
Ross: And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Joey: Oh my God! What did you say?
Ross: Nothing! What do you say to that?
Phoebe: Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
Ross: No way!
Joey: You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Ross: What?
Joey: Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
Phoebe: Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If 
  she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
Ross: You really think so?
Phoebe: I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical 
  where there'd be a really good convincing song. (Singing) ""Bam-bam, 
  don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. 
  Bam-bam-bam-bam...""
(Rachel enters and interrupts Phoebe's song.)
Rachel: Hi!
Phoebe: Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Ross: Okay.
Joey: Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Rachel: No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and 
  then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Phoebe: Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
Rachel: Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about 
  Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
(Rachel walks up to the counter.)
Ross: Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her
  how I feel.
(He stands up.)
Joey: Ross, wait!
Ross: What? What?
Joey: Could you get me a muffin?
(Ross walks up to Rachel, but Gunther gets there first.)
Gunther: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah?
Gunther: I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell
  you. I love you.
(Ross is shocked.)
Gunther: I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I
  thought you should know.
Rachel: (touched) Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the
  same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a caf√©, having coffee, or I
  see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
(She kisses him on the cheek and looks over at the others.)
Rachel: Oh... Bye guys.
(Rachel leaves.)
Ross: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Unbelievable!
Joey: Hey, you know what might help?
Ross: I'm not getting you a muffin!
¬†
[Scene: The hospital. Monica and Chandler are holding the twins, while
  two nurses are taking care of Erica.]
Monica: Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
Chandler: Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in 
  apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're 
  pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Nurse: We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
Monica: There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name 
  the girl-baby Erica.
Erica: Oh my God, that's just like my name!
Monica: Son of a gun, it is!
Erica: Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I 
  picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
Monica: Okay, well, bye!
Erica: Bye!
Chandler: Bye!
Monica: We'll call you!
Erica: Okay.
Chandler: Have fun at church-camp!
(The nurses take Erica to the recovery room. Monica and Chandler smile
  at each other.)
Monica: Oh, look at these little bunnies!
Chandler: I know! You ready to trade?
Monica: Okay.
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Alright, let's see..
(They start trying to trade babies while holding one each. They have 
  no idea how to do it, so they just shift the babies around in their 
  arms. They give up pretty quickly.)
Chandler: We could trade later.
Monica: Yeah, I'm good.
¬†
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Joey and Phoebe are there. 
  There is a white crib decorated with balloons in the middle of the 
  apartment. Also, there are boxes all over the apartment. Joey is 
  working on something on the coffee table.]
Phoebe: Hey, what are you working on?
Joey: It's a... It's a ""welcome home"" sign for the baby.
(He holds up a white poster with huge red letters. It reads, ""Welcome
  Home Baby."" There is also a huge red stain on the left of the poster.)
Phoebe: How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
(She points at the stain.)
Joey: No, I sat in the paint.
(Ross enters with a gift for the baby.)
Ross: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
Ross: No, and I'm not going to.
Phoebe: What?
Joey: Why not?
Ross: Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what 
  happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
Phoebe: How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's 
  sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you 
  slept together last night.
Ross: Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Joey: Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
(He sits down in the wet paint again.)
Phoebe: Uh, Joe?
Joey: Damn it!
Ross: Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. 
  Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Phoebe: No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet 
  somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... 
  It's a city of Gunthers!
(Mike enters with a roll of paper in his hand.)
Mike: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! What do you have there?
Mike: Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, 
  it'd be better, but..
(He shows them a beautiful banner he has made. It reads, ""Welcome to 
  the World, Baby Bing."")
Ross: Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Phoebe: Honey, that's gorgeous!
Joey: You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
(Rachel enters.)
Rachel: Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe
  they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the
  baby!
Joey: Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here
  any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Phoebe: Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's
  baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
(Monica enters carrying her son.)
Rachel: Oh my God!
Ross: Oh my God!
(They all walk over to see the baby.)
Rachel: Hi! Oh my gosh!
(Chandler enters carrying his daughter.)
Chandler: Hey.
(Everybody turns around.)
Phoebe, Ross, Rachel: Hey.
(They turn back around to see the baby Monica's carrying, but then 
  they realise what the surprise is. Ross, Mike, Phoebe and Rachel gasp 
  and stare at Chandler and his baby. Joey hasn't figured it out yet.)
Joey: (To Monica) Hey, so what is the big surprise?
Rachel: Oh.
(Joey stares at Chandler and Monica and finally puts two and two 
  together. He gasps.)
Ross: Oh my God!
Rachel: What... What...
Ross: Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, 
  right?
Monica: Yes, it's twins!
Ross: Oh my God.
Joey: Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Monica: (points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at 
  the baby Chandler is holding) and that's a girl.
Chandler: Her name is Erica.
Rachel: Aw..
Joey: Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Chandler: Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time
  together.
Monica: Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Ross: Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Phoebe: Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s
  newspaper guy, you know? ""Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow
  this story wide open!""
(Chandler and Monica carry Erica and Jack over to the crib and put
  them down carefully.)
Rachel: Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
Mike: (To Phoebe) I want one.
Phoebe: Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my
  coat.
Mike: Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
Phoebe: One? How about a whole bunch?
Mike: Really?
Phoebe: Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the
  Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda
  dull.
Rachel: Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm
  gonna miss my plane.
Monica: I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
(They hug.)
Rachel: Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch
  you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you
  guys again. I love you all so much.
Monica: I love you.
Chandler: I love you.
Monica: Call us when you get there.
Rachel: I will. Ross, come here.
(She pulls him over to the door.)
Rachel: I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
Ross: Neither will I.
(They hug as Phoebe and Joey stare at the two of them.)
Rachel: Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're 
  gonna really hate me over there.
(She leaves.)
Phoebe: So, you just let her go?
Ross: Yeah.
Joey: Hey, maybe that's for the best.
Ross: Yeah?
Joey: Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think 
  about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping 
  together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
Phoebe: But now she'll never know how he feels!
Joey: Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? 
  I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so
  long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. (Looks at
  Phoebe) Right?
(Phoebe nods.)
Joey: Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get
  over her.
Ross: Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
Joey: What?
Ross: I don't! I wanna be with her.
Joey: Really?
Ross: Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
Joey: Yeah, you are!
Phoebe: Woo!
(Monica and Chandler look shocked as Ross goes to leave.)
Phoebe: Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
Ross: My coat...
Joey: This is so cool!
Chandler: I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
Joey: But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to
  say?
Ross: I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least
  I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.
  Where - where is my coat?!
Phoebe: You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to
  the airport.
Ross: Okay, guys, wish me luck.
Phoebe: Hurry!
Joey: Good luck, good luck!
(Phoebe and Ross leave.)
¬†
[Scene: The street right in front of Central Perk. Phoebe's cab is
  there. Ross and Phoebe run over and jump in.]
Ross: There's no seatbelt!
Phoebe: That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, 
  so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
(Ross looks terrified.)
Ross: Alright, alright, let's do this!
Phoebe: Okay!
(A guy comes up and gets into the backseat of the cab.)
Ross: Hey!
Man: 18th and East End.
Phoebe: I - I don't take passengers.
Man: Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
Ross: No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
Man: Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
Phoebe: My medallion number is, ""Get out of the cab!""
Man: What?
Ross: (screaming) Get out of the cab!
Phoebe: Get out of the cab!
(The man jumps out, obviously a little scared. Phoebe drives off.)
¬†
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica, Chandler and Joey are
  there, packing the last boxes.]
Joey: Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present 
  now?
Monica: Now, that you can do.
Joey: Alright!
(Cut to Joey's apartment. Joey looks inside the cardboard box that
  used to be the home of Chick Jr. and Duck Jr., but they have
  disappeared.)
Joey: Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
¬†
[Scene: Phoebe's cab. Phoebe is driving very fast, and a terrified
  Ross has closed his eyes.]
Phoebe: You can open your eyes now.
Ross: Are we off the bridge?
Phoebe: Yes.
Ross: Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Phoebe: Yes, she jumped right back up.
(Ross opens his eyes.)
Ross: Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
Phoebe: Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
Ross: Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
Phoebe: You should have thought of that before you got in!
(They drive up to a toll-booth.)
Phoebe: Toll-booth.
Ross: What?
Phoebe: (screaming) Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the 
  glove compartment.
(Ross tries to open a plastic bag filled with quarters, but he's quite
  slow.)
Phoebe: Hurry!
Ross: Okay!
Phoebe: Okay.
(Phoebe tries to throw some quarters out the window, but she has
  forgotten to open the window, and she and Ross scream.)
Phoebe: Damn, that window is clean.
¬†
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey is still looking for the birds.]
Joey: Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,
  quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
(Monica and Chandler enter.)
Chandler: We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but
  now we understand you were doing this.
Joey: Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,
  I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
(Chandler grins, while Monica is less enthusiastic.)
Chandler: Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Monica: Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants.
  Bird feces.
Joey: Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now
  they're gone!
Chandler: Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Monica: Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Chandler: Alright.
(Monica turns around and is about to leave when she steps on
  something.)
Monica: Oh God! What did I just step on?
Joey: Oh!
Chandler: It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Monica: Oh..
Joey: You stepped on my egg roll?
Monica: I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the 
  floor.
Joey: Just put it on a plate and leave.
(She does so.)
Chandler: Okay, let's find these birds.
Joey: Alright.
(Suddenly, they hear the birds.)
Joey: Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
(They realise that the birds are in the foosball table.)
Joey: Oh! They're in the table!
Chandler: Well, that can't be good!
Joey: We gotta get them out of there!
Chandler: How?
Joey: Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Chandler: Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Joey: Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Chandler: Joey, wait! The ball!
Joey: Oh!
(The ball rolls into one of the goals, and Chandler and Joey listen in 
  horror as the ball makes its way inside the table. Finally, they can 
  hear the birds again.)
Joey: Oh God! So what do we do?
Chandler: I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Joey: Okay.
Chandler: No... It's all glued together.
Joey: Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Chandler: I don't know. Maybe.
Joey: Oh my God!
Chandler: I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Joey: All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would 
  have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. ""Those are our 
  men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the 
  most important thing in my life; my time-machine.""
Chandler: Did that movie ever get made?
Joey: It did not.
¬†
[Scene: The airport. Ross and Phoebe run in.]
Phoebe: Ross, where are you going?
Ross: To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the 
  death-cab?
Phoebe: What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have 
  you never chased anyone through the airport before?
Ross: Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Phoebe: You have to get a ticket to get past security.
Ross: What? We're never gonna make it!
Phoebe: Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
(They run to the ticket counter, but they get stuck behind a group of 
  old people who are walking very slowly.)
Ross: Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great. 
¬† 
[Scene: The gate. Rachel walks up to the man at the gate and gives him 
her passport.]
Gate attendant #1: (with a French accent) Madame, your passport 
  please?
Rachel: Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my 
  high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
Gate attendant #1: Your boarding pass, please.
Rachel: Oh.
(She starts looking through her purse, but she can't find it.)
Rachel: Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Gate attendant #1: Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
Rachel: I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, 
  but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
Gate attendant #1: Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
Rachel: Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not 
be having this problem. 
¬† 
[Scene: The ticket-counter. Ross and Phoebe come running.]
Ross: Hey, I need a ticket.
Phoebe: Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get 
  to see how it works out?
Ross: Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
Phoebe: We're on our honeymoon.
Ticket agent: And the destination?
Ross: I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
Phoebe: I'm so lucky I married you.
¬†
[Scene: The gate. Rachel is still searching for her boarding pass.]
Rachel: Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found 
  it!
(She runs up to the gate and the gate attendant standing there.)
Rachel: Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! 
You're a different person. 
¬† 
[Scene: The ticket-counter. Ross and Phoebe have their tickets and 
  start looking at the screens in order to find the gate.]
Ross: Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
Phoebe: No, did we miss it?
Ross: No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 
  minutes.
Phoebe: Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
(Phoebe picks up her cell-phone and calls Monica. Monica is still packing in her apartment.)
Monica: Hello.
Phoebe: Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
Ross: What? Hey, hey, listen..
(Monica is standing by the crib, and she's looking at her babies.)
Monica: Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises 
  the twins are making. Listen.
(She holds the phone down to the twins.)
Ross: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Monica: Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
Ross: That's alright. Listen, listen.
Monica: Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
(She holds down the phone to the twins again.)
Ross: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Monica: Isn't that cute?
Ross: That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
Monica: Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
Ross: Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
Monica: That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark 
  airport.
Ross: What?
Monica: Newark airport. Why, where are you?
Ross: JFK.
(Ross sadly hangs up the phone, while Phoebe looks at him. Cut to Rachel at the gate. She gives her boarding pass to the gate 
  attendant, and she goes onboard. The gate attendant closes the door 
and locks it.) 
¬†
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey and Chandler are still trying to get 
  the birds out of the foosball-table.]
Joey: (yelling) Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of 
  there.
Chandler: And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
(Joey picks up a hammer and a crowbar and gets ready to destroy the 
  table.)
Joey: Okay. Here goes.
Chandler: What's the matter?
Joey: I need to say goodbye to the table first.
Chandler: I understand.
Joey: Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you 
  guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You 
  guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
Chandler: I don't know. Except that, for one last time... (he touches 
  the players as he says the following) Good game, good game, good game, 
  good game, good game, good game, good game.
Joey: Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
Chandler: Well, I can't do it either.
(Monica enters.)
Monica: Hey! Did you find them?
Joey: Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
Chandler: We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
Monica: Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
(Monica grabs the hammer and the crowbar and gets ready to bust it 
open.) 
¬† 
[Scene: Phoebe's cab. She's driving faster than ever before.]
Ross: Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
(Phoebe screams.)
Phoebe: Well, I've never gone this fast before.
Ross: Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. 
  There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
Phoebe: She's got her cell, you could call her.
Ross: I am not doing this over the phone.
Phoebe: You don't have any other choice!
(She lets go of the steering wheel to get her cell-phone from her 
  purse. Ross screams and reaches over in order to hold onto the wheel. Cut to the plane. Rachel is sitting in her seat when her cell-phone 
  rings.)
Rachel: Hello?
Phoebe: Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the 
  plane?
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: (To Ross) For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
Ross: Yay.
Phoebe: Uh, Rach, hang on.
(Phoebe tries to give her phone to Ross, but he won't take it. He 
  mouths ""no."")
Rachel: Phoebe? Is everything okay?
Phoebe: Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
Rachel: What? Why?
Phoebe: I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something 
  is wrong with the left Philange.
Rachel: Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
(The passenger in the seat next to Rachel looks at her and seems a 
  little nervous.)
Rachel: Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you 
  the minute I get to Paris.
(Rachel hangs up.)
Passenger #1: Uhm, what was that?
Rachel: Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get 
  off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something 
  wrong with the left Philange.
Passenger #1: Okay, that doesn't sound good.
Rachel: I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff 
  like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
Passenger #1: But she is sometimes.
Rachel: Well...
(The passenger stands up and gets his suitcase from the overhead 
  compartment.)
Rachel: Wait, what are you doing?
Passenger #1: Well, I can't take this plane now.
Air stewardess: Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
Passenger #1: I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a 
  feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
Rachel: Could I get some peanuts?
Passenger #2: What's wrong with the plane?
Air stewardess: There's nothing wrong with the plane.
Passenger #1: Yeah! The left Philange!
Air stewardess: There is no Philange!
Passenger #1: Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
Passenger #2: I'm not flying on it!
